Michael: Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.
Pam: I'm not making any copies.
Michael: Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
Pam: Nothing new.
Michael: Lay them on me. What?
Pam: There's nothing new.
Michael: That's not what you said earlier.
Pam: Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera]

Michael: The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.

Jan: So, which health plan have you decided on?
Michael: I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
Jan: Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
Michael: I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
Jan: The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
Michael: Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.
Jan: Michael.
Michael: You gotta crack these things open.
Jan: You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
Michael: Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.
Jan: It's your job. So...
Michael: Well, it's a suicide mission, you know.
Jan: Michael... maybe... I mean...
Michael: There, there...
Jan: Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
Michael: [scoffs] When have you ever done that?
Jan: I'm doing it right now. To you.

Jim: Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?
Pam: No. I have a life.
Jim: Interesting, what's that like?
Pam: You should try it sometime.
Jim: Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
Pam: [laughs]... your problem.
Michael: Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.

Michael: There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
Jim: Gosh.
Michael: Yeah!
Jim: That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
Michael: Really?
Jim: Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?

Jim: Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.

Dwight: Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.

Jim: Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.

Dwight: OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
Michael: Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.
Dwight: OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
Michael: You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
Dwight: [to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.
Michael: Nope, you cannot use it.
Dwight: OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
Michael: Temporary workspace. You can use it.
Dwight: Thank you.

Michael: If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.

Dwight: What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
Dwight: In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead." Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.

Stanley: There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.

Pam: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
Michael: [on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?
Pam: Where are you?
Michael: Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?
Pam: Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...
Michael: Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call.
Pam: No you're not.
Michael: I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
Pam: OK.
Michael: Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
Pam: Still no one calling.

Pam: Dwight, what...
Dwight: Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
Jim: It says "workspace".
Dwight: Same thing.
Jim: If it's the same thing, then why did you write "workspace"?
Dwight: Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
Jim: You are not my superior.
Dwight: Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
Jim: I thought it was a workspace?
Pam: OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
Dwight: Yes. And my decision in final.
Pam: This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
Dwight: Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
Jim: You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
Dwight: Sure.
Jim: Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
Dwight: Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
Jim: OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
Dwight: I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
Pam: Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
Dwight: So I can lower it.

Oscar: He literally won't come out of his office.
Kevin: He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
Angela: Kevin! That's inappropriate.

Oscar: Michael, can I talk to you?
Michael: Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
Meredith: Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Michael: Ah, what? Which memo?
Pam: Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
Michael: Is it a good plan?
Dwight: It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
Oscar: It's like a pay decrease.
Pam: Michael, he made huge cuts.
Michael: Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
Dwight: Yeah, you said...
Michael: No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
Dwight: I can handle that.
Michael: OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?

Oscar: This is not good.
Angela: It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?
Oscar: What was that?
Angela: You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
Kevin: What are you guys talking about?
Angela: Nothing, Kevin.

Michael: Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... love him.

Dwight: OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.
Jim: OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
Dwight: OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.
Jim: Workspace.

Michael: You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
Pam: Where are you going?
Michael: Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn't find the knob.

Michael: So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.
Travel Agent: I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?
Michael: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...

Jim: Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
Pam: I'm inventing new diseases.
Jim: Oh, great.
Pam: So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
Jim: I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
Pam: Nice.
Jim: Thank you.

Michael: [on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
Man on Phone: You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.
Michael: Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.
Man on Phone: It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.
Michael: So it's not a free fall?
Man on Phone: It's an industrial coal elevator.
Michael: Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?

Michael: OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?

Dwight: Damnit! Damnit Jim!
Dwight: All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
Jim: What are you talking about?
Dwight: Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
Jim: OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
Dwight: Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
Dwight: You did this, didn't you?
Jim: Absolutely not.
Dwight: Yes you did.
Jim: No I didn't.
Dwight: I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!

Jim: Killer nanorobots?
Pam: It's an epidemic.

Dwight: The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] "Count Choculitis"
Jim: Sounds tough.
Dwight: Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
Jim: Do you?
Dwight: I think you need to confess...
Jim: Mmm hmm.
Dwight: ...the fact...
Jim: Yep.
Dwight: What are you doing? Those are my keys.
Jim: Good luck. [closes door and locks it]
Dwight: Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]
Stanley: [looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...

Jim: [answering phone] Jim Halpert.
Dwight: Let me out.
Jim: Who is this?
Dwight: Let me out or you're fired.
Jim: No, you can't fire me.
Dwight: Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
Jim: OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.
Pam: [on phone] Hey, Jim. It's Pam.
Jim: Hey Pam! How are you?
Dwight: Jim! Open the door!
Pam: Good, how are you? Busy?
Jim: I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
Dwight: Jim!
Pam: Um, I'm not bothering you, am I?
Jim: No, not at all.
Pam: You don't have anything you're doing?
Jim: I have nothing to do.
Dwight: Jim!
Pam: Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.
Dwight: Jim!
Jim: Oh yeah?
Pam: I might go to the mall.
Jim: The mall?
Dwight: Jim!
Pam: I need new shoes.
Jim: Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?

Jan: Hello?
Dwight: Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
Jan: This is Jan.
Dwight: Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
Jan: Who is this?
Dwight: Dwight Schrute.
Jan: From sales?
Dwight: Well...
Jan: Where's Michael Scott?
Dwight: He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
Jan: Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
Dwight: That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
Jan: Really?
Dwight: Yeah.
Jan: OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
Dwight: Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
Jan: No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.
Dwight: Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]

Michael: Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.
Ryan: Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
Michael: Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.
Stanley: Oh, thanks.
Michael: There you go.
Stanley: This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.
Michael: Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.
Dwight: Michael. Michael?
Michael: [under his breath] Oh, Christ.

Dwight: I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.

Dwight: I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
Stanley: What about confidentiality?
Dwight: You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.
Meredith: Could you mean vagina? Because if you do, I want that covered.
Dwight: I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
Meredith: A uterus is different from a vagina. I still have a vagina.

Dwight: OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?
Kevin: That's a real thing.
Dwight: Yeah, but no one here has it.
Kevin: Someone has it.

Kevin: Do you think we should go ?
Oscar: I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is.
Kevin: What is he doing?
Oscar: I don't know.

Oscar: Well?
Michael: Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
Oscar: OK, the health care plan.
Pam: Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
Michael: Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
Dwight: I most certainly did not.
Michael: Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
Angela: What about the surprise?
Michael: Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
Stanley: We all think you don't have a surprise.
Michael: All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!

Michael: When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.

Michael: [clapping hands] God, yeah... Ah! This...

Michael: Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] "Hi. I'm Mork from Ork." Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.

Dwight: Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
Jim: The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.

Andy: [to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out... [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.
Jim: Yeah.
Andy: So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?
Jim: You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
Andy: Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.
Jim: Sounds good Andy.
Karen: This is going to be an adventure.
Jim: Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
Karen: Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer?
Andy: What?

Pam: Hey!
Toby: Hey.
Pam: How'd the run go?
Toby: Ah, pretty good. I finished.
Pam: That's great!
Dwight: Psh, why is that great?
Pam: Because he accomplished something.
Dwight: What was your mile time?
Toby: About seven.
Dwight: [scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.
Toby: Well, that has wheels.
Dwight: Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.
Pam: Really, Dwight? How fast are you?
Dwight: Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
Pam: Really?

Dwight: I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.

Dwight: Man, what is taking Toby so long?
Pam: Oh, I'll just time him later.
Dwight: And you'll compare the times?
Pam: Yeah. Are you ready?
Dwight: No, my groin...
Pam: Set
Dwight: ...is really tight.
Pam: Go!
Dwight: I can't... [starts running]
Pam: Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.
Dwight: Aaaaah!
Pam: I should probably get back to work.

Michael: Here... Who's here?
Dwight: Nametag?
Michael: Yes, please.
Dwight: Karen Filippelli.
Michael: Karen Filip... [In Italian voice] Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
Dwight: Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
Michael: Okay.

Michael: My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. [exhales]

Michael: Who's next?
Dwight: That's Andy Bernard.
Michael: Andy Bernard.
Dwight: If I were you...
Michael: Saint Bernard.
Dwight: ...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
Michael: What?
Dwight: ...before noon...
Michael: I'm not...
Dwight: ...to consolidate power.
Michael: I'm not firing somebody on the first day.
Dwight: No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.

Dwight: The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.

Pam: Good morning!
Michael: Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.
Pam: Okay.

Pam: Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.

Hannah: Hello?
Michael: Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Dwight: Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Michael: Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.

Michael: You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So... As far as I'm concerned, [holds up WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] this says 'World's Best Dad'.

Michael: Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?
Tony: Gardner.
Michael: Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you. [laughs] Okay.
Tony: Thanks.
Kevin: Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.
Michael: Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.
Hannah: My bag's mostly pencils.
Michael: Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
Kevin: Can I have your pencils?
Hannah: No.
Pam: Hi!
Karen: Hi.
Pam: I'm Pam.
Karen: Karen. I love your sweater.
Pam: Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.
Karen: Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...
Michael: Welcome.
Karen: ...to knit.
Michael: Welcome, welcome, welcome! [in robot voice] Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
Karen: Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
Michael: Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?

Andy: I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.

Andy: Hello.
Michael: Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
Andy: And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
Michael: A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
Andy: Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.
Michael: Oh.
Andy: Nifty!
Michael: They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.

Michael: You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.

Martin: ...which is why they need a passing game.
Jim: Right.
Michael: [to Jim] No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: [to Martin] How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
Martin: Oh! Thanks.
Michael: Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not... so, your desk is...
Jim: Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.
Pam: Oh my god! It's really you!
Jim: Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
Pam: I know. I don't care.
Jim: Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
Pam: It's really good to see you.
Jim: You, too.

Jim: Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.

Dwight: Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
Jim: Hey, Dwight.
Dwight: Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
Jim: Okay. Sounds good.
Dwight: What are you doing?
Jim: I don't know what you're talking about.
Dwight: I have a smudge on my forehead?
Jim: No. Looks good.
Dwight: Why are you looking at my forehead?
Jim: I'm not.
Dwight: Meet my eye line, Jim!
Jim: I am.
Dwight: Stop acting like an idiot!
Jim: Okay.
Ryan: Hey, buddy. Welcome back.
Jim: Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
Ryan: I'm good! How are you? So...
Jim: Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
Ryan: Yeah.
Jim: Oh.
Ryan: Um... unless you really, really want it back.
Jim: You know, man, it's really you're call.
Ryan: Cool, thank you.
Jim: [whispers] Let me get that for you.
Ryan: Yuh.
Jim: This one taken? No. Good.

Ryan: Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.

Toby: Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says: Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it?
Kevin: Oh, yes I can.

Kevin: In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.

Andy: Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
Michael: Right.
Dwight: Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
Andy: Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
Dwight: So you'll be reporting to me, then.
Andy: Umm, on the contrary.
Dwight: My title has 'Manager' in it.
Andy: And I'm a director.
Dwight: Oh.
Andy: Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
Dwight: I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
Andy: Congratulations.

Jim: Hey, Toby!
Toby: Hey, Jim!
Jim: How are you, man?
Toby: Oh, really good.
Jim: I just wanted to say hi.
Toby: How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump]
Jim: Oh. Is that like your new thing?
Toby: No, I'm sorry, it's...
Jim: No. It's cool.
Toby: No, it's nothing. We'll just... [shakes hand]
Jim: All right. Good to be back.
Toby: So... okay.
Jim: All right.
Toby: All right... sorry... sorry about that.
Jim: No problem.
Toby: It was just...
Jim: [off camera] ...what?
Toby: Nothing.

Kevin: This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.

Michael: [talking to himself] I present the orientation video.
Dwight: We need to talk!
Michael: Not now.
Dwight: Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
Michael: I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
Dwight: Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
Michael: It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
Dwight: Ok. Who reports to who?
Michael: I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
Dwight: And then if I want...
Michael: Work it out amongst your selves!
Dwight: I...
Michael: Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?
Dwight: I...
Michael: Will you?
Dwight: One...
Michael: Please?

Kelly: Jim!
Jim: Kelly!
Kelly: Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
Jim: Really?
Kelly: Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
Jim: Great. What's new with you?
Kelly: I just told you.

Michael: Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!

Michael: Yoko shack.
Male voice: ...thank you James. [laughs]
Meredith: Hey, champagne.
Michael: Nope, no. Guests only.
Kelly: Looks like salmon.
Michael: Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.
Kelly: I eat beef.
Michael: Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
Kevin: The beef is poisoned?
Michael: No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself.
Toby: Um... You might want these orientation materials.
Michael: Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
Jim: Oh, this looks promising.
Pam: You won't be disappointed.
Michael: Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton".

Video: [Lazy Scranton Video]
Michael: Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.
Dwight: Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
Michael: So check out how we live
Michael & Dwight: in the Electric City!
Michael: They call it Scranton.
Dwight: What?
Michael: The Electric City. Scranton.
Dwight: What?
Michael: The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.
Dwight: But check that it's covered by your health care provider!

Jim: It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.

Michael: [in video] I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.

Video: [Lazy Scranton video continues]
Michael: You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
Dwight: But the little cars go in the compact spot
Michael and Dwight: Spot, spot, spot, spot ...

Michael: [on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
Michael: Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.

Karen: [recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Jim: Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
Karen: [recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Jim: Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
Karen: [recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
Jim: You feel good?
Karen: Mm-hm.
Jim: All right.
Karen: [recording phone message] Karen Filippelli.

Andy: Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?
Dwight: Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
Andy: Sure thing, buddy.

Andy: Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.

Andy: Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.
Angela: Oh.
Andy: Do you like it?
Angela: I do like it, actually.
Andy: Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
Angela: Thank you.
Andy: You're welcome.

Pam: Hey.
Jim: Hey!
Pam: What happened to grape soda?
Jim: Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
Pam: Oh. You've changed so much.
Jim: Well, I'm evolving, Pam.
Pam: So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
Jim: Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
Pam: Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
Jim: Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...
Michael: All right.
Jim: Don't...
Michael: Okay.
Jim: All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
Pam: Yeah. I know, me too.
Jim: All right!

Pam: The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.

Hannah: [using breast pump] Take a picture. It'll last longer.
Ryan: I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
Creed: Ditto that, my brother.

Hannah: Look what's on his computer.
Michael: What is that? A squid's eye or...
Hannah: It's my left breast.
Michael: How did you...
Creed: Right place at the right time.

Karen: Uh, what's that smell?
Phyllis: What smell?
Karen: Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
Phyllis: Oh, I'll help you find it.
Karen: Oh, you know. Never... .never mind.
Phyllis: What is it?
Karen: I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.
Phyllis: My perfume?
Karen: It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.
Phyllis: Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
Karen: Who's Bob Vance?
Phyllis: You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.

Stanley: I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.

Michael: People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.

Michael: I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.
Dwight: Do you have batteries?
Michael: Ssshh stupid! Um...
Andy: [sings drum beat intro to 'What is Love?']
Michael: That's it!
Andy: [sings] What is love?
Michael: Yes, yes! Okay!
Andy: Baby, don't hurt me.
Michael: Okay, here we go.
Andy & Michael: Don't hurt me! Baby, don't hurt me!
Michael: Oh!
Andy: Baby, don't hurt me!
Michael: Oh! Oh! Oh!
Andy: Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Michael: Scuse me! Scuse me!
Andy & Michael: Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Whoa-oh-oh...
Michael: You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
Andy: Whoa-oh-oh-oh.
Michael: You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!
Andy: Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.
Michael: [laughs hysterically] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
Dwight: Very funny, Michael!
Michael: Okay! Okay!
Dwight: Really funny, Michael!
Michael: All right, all right, I'm on a roll.

Michael: Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
Karen: Shouldn't we be equals?
Michael: Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
Tony: Uh... this is difficult, for me.
Michael: I understand. We're all friends.
Tony: No. I mean I can't physically. I can't get on the table.
Michael: Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
Tony: [starts to climb table]
Michael: You know what? I'll help. I will...
Tony: No, please. No.
Michael: Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!
Dwight: Do this. Come on. Ready?
Michael: Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
Dwight: On three. One... two... three.
Michael: Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.
Tony: All right. All right. Stop. Put me down.
Michael: We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!
Tony: Let me go!
Michael: I'm right in your crack!
Tony: Put me down right...
Michael: Up and over.
Tony: Put me down!
Michael: Up and over.
Tony: Put me down right now!
Michael: You've got it.
Tony: I'VE HAD ENOUGH!
Michael: You've got it, you've got it.
Tony: PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW or else!
Michael: Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
Dwight: Hey, hey. Easy.
Michael: Easy.
Tony: I'm sorry!
Michael: Don't...
Tony: It's just not going to work for me.
Michael: What...
Tony: I have to go.
Michael: I don't understand.
Tony: I was on the fence about this and... it's just not a good fit.
Michael: Well, we'll squeeze you in.
Tony: I can't work here. I have to quit.

Michael: You can't quit! On the first day. That's [deep voice] heresy, my friend! [regular voice] Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?
Tony: No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style.
Michael: My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?
Tony: No. Was it supposed to be funny?
Michael: Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.
Tony: Excuse me?
Michael: You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
Tony: But there's nothing in my desk except coupons.
Michael: Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
Dwight: That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
Michael: Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
Dwight: And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.

Andy: Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.

Hannah: Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional.
Angela: Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
Michael: Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.
Stanley: Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
Michael: No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.

Michael: The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.

Michael: Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
Dwight: What!
Michael: Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
Karen: Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?
Jim: Does he ever.

Michael: Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
Dwight: YEAH!
Michael: Yeah.
Toby: I don't... I don't think we can do that.
Michael: Go home, Toby. Just...
Martin: Hey! Why doesn't your car have a flat tire?
Michael: Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. [reads note] "You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!"
Hannah: For crying out loud.
Michael: No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...
Martin: [to Stanley] What's up with this guy?
Stanley: Got an hour? I'll try to explain.
Michael: THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!

Stanley: Trust me. It only gets worse.
Martin: Is he always like this?
Ryan: Sometimes he brings more costumes.
Hannah: When do people work?
Phyllis: Oh, we find little times during the day.
Karen: How are we going to get home?
Phyllis: Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
Karen: Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.

Michael: See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. [answers phone] Jell-o!
Jan: Michael!
Michael: Hi, Jan!
Jan: Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
Michael: I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
Jan: Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
Michael: Yes.
Jan: You do?
Michael: But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
Jan: What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
Michael: What?
Jan: He's the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
Michael: Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.

Michael: So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.
Dwight: If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
Jim: Yeah, it does, actually.
Dwight: So who will be your new Number Three?
Michael: Uh... that I have not decided yet.
Andy: Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.
Michael: Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.
Dwight: And I have to say your leadership...
Michael: Shut it...
Dwight: has brought...
Michael: Shut it! That's... [whispers to camera] suck up!

Jim: [talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
Karen: [off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
Jim: [laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
Karen: Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
Jim: Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
Karen: Yeah.
Jim: Ok, thanks.
Karen: Ok.

Jim: Hey.
Pam: Hey!
Jim: I thought you had already... left.
Pam: Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
Jim: Oh... Good.
Pam: What's up?
Jim: Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
Pam: What do you mean?
Jim: I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
Pam: Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
Jim: O..ok. Um..good.
Pam: We're friends. We'll always be friends.
Jim: Right.
Pam: It's good to have you back.
Jim: Yeah. Good to be back.

Meredith: Where'd you get that salad?
Kevin: Staples.

Andy: Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?
Dwight: Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
Andy: Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.
Dwight: Xterra's not even a real word.
Andy: Actually, it is. It's Latin for "earth."
Dwight: Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?
Andy: Yeah.
Dwight: That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
Andy: Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.
Dwight: Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
Andy: Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
Dwight: Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
Andy: Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.
Dwight: Idiot!
Andy: If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.
Dwight: If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
Andy: [coughs word] Idiot!
Dwight: [coughs sentence] You're the idiot!
Andy: [coughs sentence] Nice comeback!
Dwight: [coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.
Jim: The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.

Andy: [to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out... [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.
Jim: Yeah.
Andy: So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?
Jim: You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
Andy: Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.
Jim: Sounds good Andy.
Karen: This is going to be an adventure.
Jim: Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
Karen: Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer?
Andy: What?

Pam: Hey!
Toby: Hey.
Pam: How'd the run go?
Toby: Ah, pretty good. I finished.
Pam: That's great!
Dwight: Psh, why is that great?
Pam: Because he accomplished something.
Dwight: What was your mile time?
Toby: About seven.
Dwight: [scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.
Toby: Well, that has wheels.
Dwight: Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.
Pam: Really, Dwight? How fast are you?
Dwight: Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
Pam: Really?

Dwight: I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.

Dwight: Man, what is taking Toby so long?
Pam: Oh, I'll just time him later.
Dwight: And you'll compare the times?
Pam: Yeah. Are you ready?
Dwight: No, my groin...
Pam: Set
Dwight: ...is really tight.
Pam: Go!
Dwight: I can't... [starts running]
Pam: Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.
Dwight: Aaaaah!
Pam: I should probably get back to work.

Michael: Here... Who's here?
Dwight: Nametag?
Michael: Yes, please.
Dwight: Karen Filippelli.
Michael: Karen Filip... [In Italian voice] Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
Dwight: Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
Michael: Okay.

Michael: My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. [exhales]

Michael: Who's next?
Dwight: That's Andy Bernard.
Michael: Andy Bernard.
Dwight: If I were you...
Michael: Saint Bernard.
Dwight: ...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
Michael: What?
Dwight: ...before noon...
Michael: I'm not...
Dwight: ...to consolidate power.
Michael: I'm not firing somebody on the first day.
Dwight: No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.

Dwight: The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.

Pam: Good morning!
Michael: Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.
Pam: Okay.

Pam: Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.

Hannah: Hello?
Michael: Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Dwight: Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Michael: Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.

Michael: You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So... As far as I'm concerned, [holds up WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] this says 'World's Best Dad'.

Michael: Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?
Tony: Gardner.
Michael: Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you. [laughs] Okay.
Tony: Thanks.
Kevin: Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.
Michael: Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.
Hannah: My bag's mostly pencils.
Michael: Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
Kevin: Can I have your pencils?
Hannah: No.
Pam: Hi!
Karen: Hi.
Pam: I'm Pam.
Karen: Karen. I love your sweater.
Pam: Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.
Karen: Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...
Michael: Welcome.
Karen: ...to knit.
Michael: Welcome, welcome, welcome! [in robot voice] Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
Karen: Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
Michael: Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?

Andy: I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.

Andy: Hello.
Michael: Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
Andy: And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
Michael: A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
Andy: Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.
Michael: Oh.
Andy: Nifty!
Michael: They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.

Michael: You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.

Martin: ...which is why they need a passing game.
Jim: Right.
Michael: [to Jim] No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: [to Martin] How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
Martin: Oh! Thanks.
Michael: Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not... so, your desk is...
Jim: Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.
Pam: Oh my god! It's really you!
Jim: Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
Pam: I know. I don't care.
Jim: Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
Pam: It's really good to see you.
Jim: You, too.

Jim: Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.

Dwight: Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
Jim: Hey, Dwight.
Dwight: Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
Jim: Okay. Sounds good.
Dwight: What are you doing?
Jim: I don't know what you're talking about.
Dwight: I have a smudge on my forehead?
Jim: No. Looks good.
Dwight: Why are you looking at my forehead?
Jim: I'm not.
Dwight: Meet my eye line, Jim!
Jim: I am.
Dwight: Stop acting like an idiot!
Jim: Okay.
Ryan: Hey, buddy. Welcome back.
Jim: Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
Ryan: I'm good! How are you? So...
Jim: Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
Ryan: Yeah.
Jim: Oh.
Ryan: Um... unless you really, really want it back.
Jim: You know, man, it's really you're call.
Ryan: Cool, thank you.
Jim: [whispers] Let me get that for you.
Ryan: Yuh.
Jim: This one taken? No. Good.

Ryan: Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.

Toby: Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says: Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it?
Kevin: Oh, yes I can.

Kevin: In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.

Andy: Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
Michael: Right.
Dwight: Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
Andy: Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
Dwight: So you'll be reporting to me, then.
Andy: Umm, on the contrary.
Dwight: My title has 'Manager' in it.
Andy: And I'm a director.
Dwight: Oh.
Andy: Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
Dwight: I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
Andy: Congratulations.

Jim: Hey, Toby!
Toby: Hey, Jim!
Jim: How are you, man?
Toby: Oh, really good.
Jim: I just wanted to say hi.
Toby: How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump]
Jim: Oh. Is that like your new thing?
Toby: No, I'm sorry, it's...
Jim: No. It's cool.
Toby: No, it's nothing. We'll just... [shakes hand]
Jim: All right. Good to be back.
Toby: So... okay.
Jim: All right.
Toby: All right... sorry... sorry about that.
Jim: No problem.
Toby: It was just...
Jim: [off camera] ...what?
Toby: Nothing.

Kevin: This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.

Michael: [talking to himself] I present the orientation video.
Dwight: We need to talk!
Michael: Not now.
Dwight: Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
Michael: I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
Dwight: Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
Michael: It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
Dwight: Ok. Who reports to who?
Michael: I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
Dwight: And then if I want...
Michael: Work it out amongst your selves!
Dwight: I...
Michael: Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?
Dwight: I...
Michael: Will you?
Dwight: One...
Michael: Please?

Kelly: Jim!
Jim: Kelly!
Kelly: Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
Jim: Really?
Kelly: Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
Jim: Great. What's new with you?
Kelly: I just told you.

Michael: Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!

Michael: Yoko shack.
Male voice: ...thank you James. [laughs]
Meredith: Hey, champagne.
Michael: Nope, no. Guests only.
Kelly: Looks like salmon.
Michael: Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.
Kelly: I eat beef.
Michael: Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
Kevin: The beef is poisoned?
Michael: No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself.
Toby: Um... You might want these orientation materials.
Michael: Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
Jim: Oh, this looks promising.
Pam: You won't be disappointed.
Michael: Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton".

Video: [Lazy Scranton Video]
Michael: Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.
Dwight: Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
Michael: So check out how we live
Michael & Dwight: in the Electric City!
Michael: They call it Scranton.
Dwight: What?
Michael: The Electric City. Scranton.
Dwight: What?
Michael: The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.
Dwight: But check that it's covered by your health care provider!

Jim: It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.

Michael: [in video] I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.

Video: [Lazy Scranton video continues]
Michael: You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
Dwight: But the little cars go in the compact spot
Michael and Dwight: Spot, spot, spot, spot ...

Michael: [on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
Michael: Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.

Karen: [recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Jim: Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
Karen: [recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
Jim: Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
Karen: [recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
Jim: You feel good?
Karen: Mm-hm.
Jim: All right.
Karen: [recording phone message] Karen Filippelli.

Andy: Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?
Dwight: Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
Andy: Sure thing, buddy.

Andy: Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.

Andy: Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.
Angela: Oh.
Andy: Do you like it?
Angela: I do like it, actually.
Andy: Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
Angela: Thank you.
Andy: You're welcome.

Pam: Hey.
Jim: Hey!
Pam: What happened to grape soda?
Jim: Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
Pam: Oh. You've changed so much.
Jim: Well, I'm evolving, Pam.
Pam: So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
Jim: Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
Pam: Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
Jim: Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...
Michael: All right.
Jim: Don't...
Michael: Okay.
Jim: All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
Pam: Yeah. I know, me too.
Jim: All right!

Pam: The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.

Hannah: [using breast pump] Take a picture. It'll last longer.
Ryan: I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
Creed: Ditto that, my brother.

Hannah: Look what's on his computer.
Michael: What is that? A squid's eye or...
Hannah: It's my left breast.
Michael: How did you...
Creed: Right place at the right time.

Karen: Uh, what's that smell?
Phyllis: What smell?
Karen: Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
Phyllis: Oh, I'll help you find it.
Karen: Oh, you know. Never... .never mind.
Phyllis: What is it?
Karen: I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.
Phyllis: My perfume?
Karen: It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.
Phyllis: Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
Karen: Who's Bob Vance?
Phyllis: You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.

Stanley: I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.

Michael: People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.

Michael: I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.
Dwight: Do you have batteries?
Michael: Ssshh stupid! Um...
Andy: [sings drum beat intro to 'What is Love?']
Michael: That's it!
Andy: [sings] What is love?
Michael: Yes, yes! Okay!
Andy: Baby, don't hurt me.
Michael: Okay, here we go.
Andy & Michael: Don't hurt me! Baby, don't hurt me!
Michael: Oh!
Andy: Baby, don't hurt me!
Michael: Oh! Oh! Oh!
Andy: Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Michael: Scuse me! Scuse me!
Andy & Michael: Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Whoa-oh-oh...
Michael: You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
Andy: Whoa-oh-oh-oh.
Michael: You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!
Andy: Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.
Michael: [laughs hysterically] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
Dwight: Very funny, Michael!
Michael: Okay! Okay!
Dwight: Really funny, Michael!
Michael: All right, all right, I'm on a roll.

Michael: Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
Karen: Shouldn't we be equals?
Michael: Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
Tony: Uh... this is difficult, for me.
Michael: I understand. We're all friends.
Tony: No. I mean I can't physically. I can't get on the table.
Michael: Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
Tony: [starts to climb table]
Michael: You know what? I'll help. I will...
Tony: No, please. No.
Michael: Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!
Dwight: Do this. Come on. Ready?
Michael: Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
Dwight: On three. One... two... three.
Michael: Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.
Tony: All right. All right. Stop. Put me down.
Michael: We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!
Tony: Let me go!
Michael: I'm right in your crack!
Tony: Put me down right...
Michael: Up and over.
Tony: Put me down!
Michael: Up and over.
Tony: Put me down right now!
Michael: You've got it.
Tony: I'VE HAD ENOUGH!
Michael: You've got it, you've got it.
Tony: PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW or else!
Michael: Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
Dwight: Hey, hey. Easy.
Michael: Easy.
Tony: I'm sorry!
Michael: Don't...
Tony: It's just not going to work for me.
Michael: What...
Tony: I have to go.
Michael: I don't understand.
Tony: I was on the fence about this and... it's just not a good fit.
Michael: Well, we'll squeeze you in.
Tony: I can't work here. I have to quit.

Michael: You can't quit! On the first day. That's [deep voice] heresy, my friend! [regular voice] Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?
Tony: No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style.
Michael: My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?
Tony: No. Was it supposed to be funny?
Michael: Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.
Tony: Excuse me?
Michael: You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
Tony: But there's nothing in my desk except coupons.
Michael: Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
Dwight: That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
Michael: Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
Dwight: And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.

Andy: Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.

Hannah: Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional.
Angela: Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
Michael: Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.
Stanley: Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
Michael: No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.

Michael: The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.

Michael: Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
Dwight: What!
Michael: Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
Karen: Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?
Jim: Does he ever.

Michael: Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
Dwight: YEAH!
Michael: Yeah.
Toby: I don't... I don't think we can do that.
Michael: Go home, Toby. Just...
Martin: Hey! Why doesn't your car have a flat tire?
Michael: Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. [reads note] "You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!"
Hannah: For crying out loud.
Michael: No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...
Martin: [to Stanley] What's up with this guy?
Stanley: Got an hour? I'll try to explain.
Michael: THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!

Stanley: Trust me. It only gets worse.
Martin: Is he always like this?
Ryan: Sometimes he brings more costumes.
Hannah: When do people work?
Phyllis: Oh, we find little times during the day.
Karen: How are we going to get home?
Phyllis: Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
Karen: Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.

Michael: See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. [answers phone] Jell-o!
Jan: Michael!
Michael: Hi, Jan!
Jan: Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
Michael: I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
Jan: Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
Michael: Yes.
Jan: You do?
Michael: But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
Jan: What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
Michael: What?
Jan: He's the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
Michael: Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.

Michael: So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.
Dwight: If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
Jim: Yeah, it does, actually.
Dwight: So who will be your new Number Three?
Michael: Uh... that I have not decided yet.
Andy: Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.
Michael: Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.
Dwight: And I have to say your leadership...
Michael: Shut it...
Dwight: has brought...
Michael: Shut it! That's... [whispers to camera] suck up!

Jim: [talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
Karen: [off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
Jim: [laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
Karen: Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
Jim: Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
Karen: Yeah.
Jim: Ok, thanks.
Karen: Ok.

Jim: Hey.
Pam: Hey!
Jim: I thought you had already... left.
Pam: Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
Jim: Oh... Good.
Pam: What's up?
Jim: Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
Pam: What do you mean?
Jim: I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
Pam: Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
Jim: O..ok. Um..good.
Pam: We're friends. We'll always be friends.
Jim: Right.
Pam: It's good to have you back.
Jim: Yeah. Good to be back.

Meredith: Where'd you get that salad?
Kevin: Staples.

Andy: Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?
Dwight: Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
Andy: Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.
Dwight: Xterra's not even a real word.
Andy: Actually, it is. It's Latin for "earth."
Dwight: Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?
Andy: Yeah.
Dwight: That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
Andy: Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.
Dwight: Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
Andy: Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
Dwight: Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
Andy: Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.
Dwight: Idiot!
Andy: If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.
Dwight: If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
Andy: [coughs word] Idiot!
Dwight: [coughs sentence] You're the idiot!
Andy: [coughs sentence] Nice comeback!
Dwight: [coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.
Dwight: Good morning everybody. Who would like an authentic New York bagel? Hmmm? Stanley?
Stanley: Thank you. [reaches for bagel]
Dwight: No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.
Andy: Wow. H & H. You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?
Dwight: Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
Phyllis: This is really nice Dwight, thanks.
Andy: Thanks.
Dwight: Oh, don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one.

Dwight: Good morning Michael.
Michael: Morning Dwight.
Dwight: Hungry?
Michael: No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers. Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.
Dwight: Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.
Michael: Well, yeah...
Dwight: You're thinking of deer penis.
Michael: It worked.
Dwight: Regardless. That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry. [holds up tray] Bagel?
Michael: I don't mind if I do.
Dwight: K. I brought cheese too.
Michael: I'm taking one for my lady friend.
Dwight: Excellent.
Michael: Brain food. Thank you very much.
Dwight: Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me.

Dwight: Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Geez. When did everyone get so cynical?

Dwight: Pam, would you care for a bagel?
Pam: Oh, no thank you.
Dwight: That's right. You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time. I'll try again. Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
Pam: I have an early lunch.

Pam: Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom. I don't know. I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go. No way out. No way out.

Erin: These are amazing. You took all these?
Ryan: I've always found beauty in uncommon places. Homeless people. Graffiti. Photography lets me capture all that. Have you ever been photographed before?
Erin: Oh just by like friends.
Ryan: Well here's what I've been doing around here. It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
Helene: [walks into the office] Whoohoo! Pammy?
Pam: Hey! [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.
Helene: Thank you. [they hug]
Michael: [comes over to hug them both] My girls. There they are. [Pam walks away]

Michael: Birthday lunch. Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch. It'll cure all of your "Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "I don't really see them together". So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine. Take with food.

Angela: Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
Pam: I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
Michael: Yeah--
Kevin: Hi.
Michael: I think everyone has meet Helene. Shall we?

Helene: Wait a minute. [looks at the bag in Michael's hand] Is that another birthday present for me cause you already gave me a necklace.
Kelly: Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head]
Helene: Tell her how you gave it to me.
Michael: No, that wouldn't be--
Helene: He put it around my neck while I was still asleep this morning. What a nice way to wake up.
Michael: Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.
Kevin: Because of sex?
Michael: Hey--
Pam: Kevin!
Michael: Please, Kevin. You're fired. [Kevin looks at Jim; Jim shakes his head] Sorry, sorry. Work with a bunch of idiots. Shall we go?
Pam: Yes, let's go. [looks at Erin and nods]
Erin: Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent.
Pam: Oh, you guys. Just one second. [picks up phone] Oh my gosh! Are you serious? Shipping emergency. I don't think I can go to lunch.
Jim: Oh man, that's crazy. Right as we were on our way out too.
Pam: I know. Isn't that always how it goes?
Jim: Rarely. If ever. Let me give it a whirl. I'll talk to them.
Pam: I want to handle it.
Jim: That's okay.
Pam: I feel like its--
Jim: It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello? Well that's great. [hangs up phone] Turns out the paper was there all along.
Creed: [sighs] Thank God.

Creed: Something's up. That paper was never supposed to arrive.

Helene: So, Pammy-- are you still liking sales?
Pam: Yeah-- it's exciting.
Helene: Well, you know-- Michael and I were-- talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales.
Jim: Pam's sales are fine actually.
Michael: Just want you to succeed Pammy. You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today.
Pam: Thank you.
Michael: Today is about family.

Pam: Why did I get in the car? I could of struggled. I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.

Andy: Oh, Dwight. I have a little surprise for you.
Dwight: Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
Andy: Yes! [they laugh] And I wanted to return the favor. I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory.
Dwight: Wow--
Andy: Feel it against your cheek.
Dwight: I will. [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face]

Andy: You give me a gift-- Bam! Thank you note. You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP. You do me a favor-- Wham! Favor returned. Do not test my politeness.

Dwight: Let me get that door for you-- [runs to open door]
Andy: Whoa--
Dwight: There you go!
Andy: Thank you very much. Now I've got it for you. [holds open door]
Dwight: Oh... goodness... thanks. You know, here's a healthy fitness tip. If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.
Andy: Is that right?
Dwight: Observe. [walks towards desk]
Andy: Huh. [laughs; follows Dwight]
Dwight: Right?
Andy: That really works.
Dwight: Yeah, feel free to use that. Anytime. Okay.
Andy: Hey-- oh, hold on a second. Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.
Dwight: [straightens Andy's tie] And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
Andy: Whoa-- thank you very much. [takes off Dwight's glasses and blows on them] Oh boy.
Dwight: Thank you very much for that.
Andy: [puts Dwight's glasses back on Dwight's face] You are very welcome.
Dwight: [pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat. Allow me.
Andy: [pulls out Dwight's chair] Have a seat yourself.
Dwight: You know what? I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
Andy: Not necessary.
Dwight: No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]
Andy: You didn't have to do that.

Dwight: Andy is complicating things. But I'm not worried. This will only up my game.

Michael: Hello. Scott. Table for four.
Hostess: Welcome Scott family. It'll be just a moment.
Pam: I use to love coming here. The chicken parm is good. Big part of my childhood. Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.

Michael: What table should we take? So many to choose from.
Jim: Wow.
Helene: [sees table decorated with a banner and balloons] Oh my God!
Michael: What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh, wait a second! You mean this one? Wow!
Pam: Michael, you did all this?
Michael: Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it.
Helene: Well, thank you. All of you.
Michael: Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.
Helene: Oh you'll love it. You can have my guide books. I think I'm done with those really long plane rides.
Michael: Oh. Thank you. Thanks for lending me the books.
Pam: So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?
Helene: [laughs] Sticking with 49.
Pam: 49 again? That's nine years in a row. This is now our longest family tradition.
Michael: That's funny.
Helene: Well, as long as you're running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one. Let's see your six months pregnant, but you've only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to?
Jim: Oh, burn. Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]
Michael: You're 54 years old.
Helene: No. I'm 58.
Michael: You're 58 years old?
Helene: Uh huh.
Michael: Congratulations.

Michael: The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle. If anything I am robbing the grave.

Pam: Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?
Helene: Oh, well I like Nana, but I also like the classic Grandma.
Pam: Please be Grandma.
Jim: Definitely Grandma.
Pam: I want you to be Grandma.
Helene: Oh, Michael what do you think? Grandma?
Michael: [nods uncomfortably] That--
Pam: Yay, Grandma!

Michael: Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?
Pam: Maybe.
Michael: Helene?
Helene: Oh, oh no. I don't think so.
Michael: I am. I'm definitely going to do it. I've already got the run and the bike thing down. Just need to learn how to swim. Come on, you in?
Helene: Oh no, I think a triathlon is pretty much something I can rule out. It just-- doesn't interest me.
Michael: So it's a matter of interest. Good, okay. It's not anything you would have ever done.
Helene: Hmm... I might have done it when I was younger, but now there's just other things I'd rather be doing, instead of running and jumping and swimming--
Michael: Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.
Helene: Oh--
Michael: You're thinking of the broad jump. Would you try-- bungee jumping?
Helene: No, no... [laughs]
Michael: Snowboarding?
Helene: You want to go snowboarding?
Michael: I might.
Helene: Michael, what are you talking about?
Michael: [sighs] Nothing. Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.

Michael: Do I really want to go snowboarding? No. But I would like to if I wanted to.

Andy: [singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food]
Dwight: What's going on in here?
Oscar: Andy bought lunch.
Dwight: Oh... no... really?
Andy: Yep, yep. Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.
Dwight: There is no book. There's only a survival guide.
Andy: You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.
Dwight: Okay, well, allow me. You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make. I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!

Michael: So we should get the check?
Pam: What about your gift Michael?
Michael: Oh, no, no, no. No. It's stupid. You'd hate it. I hate it.
Helene: I'm sure I won't.
Michael: Yes you will.
Pam: He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
Helene: Gimme. Look at this wrapping paper. It's got the word love on it in every language.
Pam: Aww--
Michael: I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all. Might as well of been toilet paper.
Helene: [opens present, reads inscription] A scrapbook of our first memories by Michael Gary Scott. For my girlfriend Helene on your birthday. [laughs]

Michael: That's just an arbitrary title.
Helene: Ok, there's a penny. What's that from?
Jim: Penny for your thoughts.
Helene: It was from the wishing well at the mall. You threw it in. I went back later, waded in and I found it.
Jim: Wow.
Pam: That's amazing.
Michael: It's not amazing... at all. It's sort of weird that I went and did that. And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.
Helene: [looking through the book] A poem!
Michael: Oh that I plagiarized I think.
Helene: [reading] I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay...
Jim: [whispers to Pam] Shel Silverstein.
Pam: Yeah.
Helene: Um-- I have the measles and the mumps, a gash, a rash and purple bumps. And my teachers really mean-- Happy Birthday , I love you Helene.
Pam: That's really nice Michael.
Michel: I think it sucks.
Helene: I think it's wonderful, absolutely wonderful.
Michael: Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It's a generational-- sort of gap between us.
Helene: [hugging book] God... it's a scrapbook.
Pam: Home run Michael.
Jim: You set the bar so high.
Michael: That was a bunt.

Andy: Whoa, whoa Dwight. I'm going to do this.
Dwight: Hey, hey, hey-- relax I got it covered.
Andy: No, I insist.
Dwight: No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist. [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door]
Andy: Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.
Dwight: Don't worry about it. You can just owe me.

Pam: Hey. Where'd you go?
Michael: Oh, just went to the bathroom.
Pam: And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
Michael: I got thirsty.
Pam: Okay, weirdo. Come on. It's time for cake.

Michael: Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly. And then I met Helene. And she is great and she already knows and has done everything that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it. But, I think I want to do those things myself.

Pam: Cakes really good.
Helene: Oh, I know. I love how they use butter cream frosting.
Michael: Finish your cake, Helene.
Helene: Hmmm?
Michael: I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible I need to tell you. I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.

Michael: Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much. But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.
Pam: Michael. Michael ,it's okay.
Michael: No it's not.
Pam: I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy. And that makes me happy.
Michael: Wow. That just-- you've really grown.
Pam: Well--
Michael: [covering eyes] Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who-- who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I've never-- I don't know him. There's another woman. And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.
Jim: Okay, so--
Michael: And I want kids. And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
Pam: Michael.
Michael: It's not my decision. It's mother nature. And mother has very strict rules about fer-- [waitress comes over to pour water; long pause] -- tility.
Helene: I, um-- I got it.

Helene: I'm 58. What am I supposed to do now?
Michael: Well, hobbies--
Jim: Stop.

Andy: [reaching for something on the top shelf] Ahh.
Dwight: What's going on?
Andy: Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me.
Dwight: Alright, move it.

Andy: What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something? That is a recipe for a ghost.

Dwight: Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.
Andy: It's like a little envelope-- there you go.
Dwight: Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha-- [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.
Andy: Surprise! [laughs] It's from everybody. $15 value.

Dwight: Dammit. I am no closer to taking Jim down. What a waste of a day. I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor] They're mushrooms. They don't get that high.

Michael: Pamela Beesly Halpert--
Pam: What?
Michael: May I have a word with you in my office please?
Pam: I am working.
Michael: Well, this is a work related matter.
Pam: Really?
Michael: Yes.
Pam: Really?
Michael: Yes. Join me please, won't you? [Pam gets up and follows Michael into his office] I am going to give you a raise.
Pam: Why?
Michael: Because of all the good work you've done.
Pam: I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
Michael: That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam. It's about attitude.
Pam: I have the worst attitude of any person here.
Michael: Do you want the raise or what?
Pam: Yeah, I'll take it. [turns to leave]
Michael: Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached. [Pam sighs] And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
Pam: You're bribing me?
Michael: No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to hit me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--
Pam: I want to hit you.
Michael: What?
Pam: I want to hit you. I'll do that.
Michael: [nervous laughter] Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?
Pam: No. Are you kidding?
Michael: Ye-- No. Alright. I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--
Pam: No. I don't think I can hit you in the office.
Michael: Okay.
Pam: So, um... we'll do it after work. In the parking lot. In front of everyone. I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.
Michael: Okay.
Pam: Okay.
Michael: Okay.
Pam: See you then.
Michael: See you.

Ryan: Hey.
Michael: Hey.
Ryan: Quick question.
Kelly: Yeah.
Ryan: Are you scared?
Michael: Never. About what? A little-- what are you talking--
Ryan: We heard about the punch.
Michael: What punch?
Kelly: Pam. She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
Michael: I'm pretty sure we said slap.
Kelly: No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
Ryan: I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen. Do you?
Michael: I-- mmm-- I'm good.
Ryan: alright. See you there.

Michael: Hey.
Jim: Hey.
Michael: Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
Jim: Inappropriate.
Michael: I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?
Jim: All the time.
Michael: Really?
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: She strong?
Jim: She wants it bad Michael.
Michael: Can you stop this?
Jim: I can.
Michael: Okay.
Jim: And I don't support her choice to hit you.
Michael: I don't either.
Jim: But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
Michael: Mmm-hmm. I know.
Jim: I just need some time.
Michael: You gotta do something--
Jim: I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
Michael: How much time do you think you'll need?
Jim: No more than a week. Maybe two weeks.
Michael: Come on, man!

Toby: Pam, can I talk to you for a second?
Pam: Oh...
Toby: I heard about the hit. Just-- make sure it's off company property, right?
Pam: Right.
Toby: Okay, I think we should probably be okay.
Pam: Okay.
Toby: Okay. And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot. So its-- its all one motion through the-- body. So you stay a little low and there's a twist. You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm. [demonstrates punch] Pow!
Pam: [stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.
Toby: Yes.
Pam: Okay. [punches Toby's hand]
Toby: Yes.
Pam: Wow!
Toby: Okay.

Meredith: Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.
Kevin: My money's on Pam.
Oscar: It's not a fight. What other outcome could there be?
Kevin: Michael could win.
Oscar: How? He can't hit back.
Kevin: Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?

Michael: Am I scared of getting hit in the face? No. Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege. I'm scared I'm gonna love it. [claps hands] Let's do this.

Michael: It's okay guys... I can handle this. Everybody can go home.
Kevin: We're here for the show, Michael.
Michael: You're just a bunch of voyeurs. Are you eating popcorn?
Kelly: It has almost no calories.
Pam: Are you ready?
Michael: Yes.
Pam: [goes to punch Michael; he flinches] You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
Michael: I know. [sighs] Okay. Alright. [Pam goes to punch him again] Oh-- God!
Pam: Michael, you have to put your hands down.
Angela: Put your hands in your pockets.
Michael: Okay! [braces himself] Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.
Pam: What are you sorry for?
Michael: So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose.
Pam: How about for dating my mom?
Michael: Maybe that--
Pam: And dumping her on her birthday.
Michael: Yes.
Pam: Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.
Michael: Okay. I promise. [Pam starts to walk away] For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him; he gasps]
Phyllis: Holy crap.
Pam: Are you okay?
Michael: No!
Pam: You're okay.
Jim: Feel better?
Pam: No. You were right.
Dwight: [walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?
Michael: I don't know.
Dwight: Let's get some raw meat on that face. I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.

Michael: As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes. And guess what? I have four kids. And I have a hover-car and a hover-house. And my wife is a runner and it shows. And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together. And I am happy and I am rich and I never die. It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me.

Michael: Ahh... [Dwight is holding a frozen chicken to his face]
Dwight: Good, good. Keep it on there for another five minutes. Just let the swelling go down.
Michael: Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight.
Dwight: Fire Jim.
Michael: No.
Erin: [to Gabe] They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house. [run to conference room, everyone is watching the news on a monitor]
Reporter: Police have now surrounded the apartment complex.
Michael: [whispering to Pam] They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving.
Reporter: It is unknown if he is armed with anything.
Kevin: They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
Dwight: [sighs] They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
Angela: Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
Gabe: Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco.
Erin: It's pronounced wacko.

Jim: Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.

Kelly: Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out? [phone rings, Kelly answers and hangs up]
Andy: I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.
Kevin: No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
Michael: Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street! [runs out of conference room.] Come on everybody! [all quickly follow]

Michael: [on sidewalk] There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it! [all groan]

Michael: [collecting pebbles off the street into a jar] Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught? [old man voice] Well kiddo, I was there. I was there... And I'll tell you what. [shakes jar of pebbles] You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship.

Erin: Michael!
Michael: Walk with me.
Erin: Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
Michael: [obviously faking being serious the whole time] Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!
Jim: [confused] Okay?
Erin: Yeah it's a TV show...
Michael: Dwight! Sign please. I don't have time for parties I don't have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
Stanley: I...
Michael: Cancel it! Are you still here? [to Erin]
Erin: Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
Michael: MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I'm a very busy man. I don't have time for your TV show.
Erin: [sad] Okay, sorry.
Michael: I'm joking.
Erin: Wait which one?
Michael: I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry. [Erin laughs] I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek.
Erin: Good me too!
Michael: You know who my favorite character is? The invalid. [Jim makes a face] I am coming to your party.

Erin: I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.

Kelly: [reacting to Erin's invitation] No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!

Kelly: And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.

Angela: Are you going? [to Dwight]
Dwight: Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
Angela: I would watch that.
Dwight: Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.

Andy: [to Erin] You're having a party at Gabe's apartment?
Erin: Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
Andy: You would?
Erin: You and Michael are always the life of the party!
Andy: Try and keep me from coming!
Erin: Why would I keep you from coming?
Andy: Try and hide it, I will track this party down!
Erin: Why would I hide it! [giggling]

Michael: Kevin!
Kevin: Hey, you going tonight?
Michael: Yes, I am. Are you?
Kevin: Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
Michael: What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss.
Kevin: No he's not the boss.
Michael: Why did you just say he was the boss?
Kevin: 'Cause, you're the boss!
Michael: Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?

Erin: [to Michael at Gabe's apartment] It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
Michael: Uh huh...
Erin: Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
Michael: Big...
Erin: Those posters used to be real French ads.
Michael: All right!

Gabe: So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here's what's been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and...
Michael: [interrupting] Okay okay okay.

Michael: Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I'll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I'm ready for bed!

Michael: [tossing pizza dough in the air]
Gabe: You don't really toss the dough.
Michael: Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you. [throws pizza dough, hits the ceiling]

Gabe: [walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.
Jim: You play? [referring to keyboard]
Gabe: Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.
Jim: You can't even do that.
Cece: [crying]
Pam: She's up! Great!

Pam: Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night.

Erin: [peeking into various rooms] The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting! [Glee begins as all get nearby to watch]
Phyllis: [to Kelly] Who's that?
Kelly: Finn.
Phyllis: Who's that?
Kelly: Rachel.
Phyllis: Which one's Glee?
Kelly: You have to stop.
Michael: Where's Michael? Where's Michael? We can't start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin! [turning up volume]
Gabe: [takes remote] It's a little loud...
Michael: Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! [takes remote, raises volume] There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
Gabe: [lowers volum] Some of us are trying to have a conversation.
Michael: Well some of us are trying to have a...
Gabe: I'll just turn the captions on.
Michael: [grabs different remote from the table] Well I will turn up the volume.
Gabe: That's for the other box.
Michael: Okay... Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!

Oscar: [noise on TV, Oscar pauses show] That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
Kelly: You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
Oscar: You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.

Pam: [enters on Michael alone sitting on a bed watching Glee] Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.
Michael: Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay?
Pam: You have a gun in your desk?

Ryan: [in Gabe's bedroom with Andy] Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
Andy: No what?
Ryan: What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
Andy: Yeah.

Michael: [Pam in the background struggling with Cece] Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.
Dwight: Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
Pam: Maybe I should go.
Dwight: [continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.

Daryl: [to Andy] Take a shot.
Andy: Oh thanks.
Daryl: Wow, so much Asia stuff. I wonder if there's a guy in China right now, looking at a bunch of our stuff.
Andy: Why does Erin like Gabe?
Daryl: Andy look, all I know is that if I was a girl, and I had to choose between the tall dude who loved Asia, and the you looking dude who loves sweaters and wearing sweaters... I'd choose you.
Andy: That's really nice, thank you.
Daryl: And I'd blow your mind.
Andy: [pours powdered seahorse into his wine glass]

Jim: [changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.]
Oscar: Jim what are you doing?
Jim: Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
Oscar: Flip it back please.
Jim: Okay... [changes back to Glee]
Kelly: The show's back on, what happened?
Ryan: We're behind.
Oscar: Go to the recorded version.
Kelly: Oh my God what song was that?
Erin: I wasn't recording it.
Oscar: What?!
Kelly: [texting] What song was it?
Erin: Wait, why do you have to record it?
Oscar: This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
Erin: Jim. [Jim gives her the remote]
Kelly: Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? [Jim leaves] 'Cause we missed it!

Pam: If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
Dwight: That would be nice wouldn't it?
Pam: I can't even talk about it.
Dwight: You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
Pam: I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.
Dwight: Really? Oh... Then here we are.
Erin: Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some [Dwight shushes her] help so, [Erin whispering] he was wondering if you could help him. [Michael goes with Erin]

Andy: [enters room where Phyllis is pouring wine, using stadium announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance! [sniffs her] Isn't that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?
Phyllis: You know your perfumes!
Andy: My nanny used to wear that.

Andy: I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe's doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.

Erin: Look who I found! [points to Michael]
Michael: Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find.
Gabe: Let's go ahead and wash our hands.
Michael: Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
Gabe: Yep! Waste not right?
Michael: So these are pizza dogs, they aren't pigs in a blanket per se.
Erin: Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
Michael: Well...
Erin: Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
Michael: He's the longest baby in this room.
Erin: What's the longest thing you've ever seen? [Michael chuckles] For me it was the tale from Jets.
Gabe: Erin you don't have to...
Michael: You know what Erin you do have to.
Gabe: Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.
Michael: [grimacing] That's what she said. [leaves]

Jim: [whispering] Hey.
Pam: It's a miracle. She loves him.
Jim: I don't know about, love...
Dwight: She loves me.
Angela: [whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
Dwight: Well something's come up, I have to go.
Pam: No no no no no! She'll wake up!
Dwight: I have something to do.
Pam: Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
Dwight: I do. But you married my worst enemy.
Jim: Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
Dwight: Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
Pam: Absolutely! [starts out]
Dwight: From Jim.
Jim: I don't think that's gonna...
Pam: Do it!
Jim: What kind of pizza would you like?
Dwight: Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.

Michael: [outside opening Gabe's cable hookup box] Okay... Alright.

TV: And the winner is, by two votes- [TV goes blank]
Kelly: Ahhh! What's going on?!?!

Andy: [muttering going on all around, Andy looks sick] Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?
Creed: Beleniege!
Andy: What does this say?
Creed: HI mahhhh. Boo yowww. Gunjo! Ooh uncow!
Andy: [confused, rushes out of the room to the room Erin's in, picks up phone, talking fast] Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it's here. Oh if it isn't the bell of the ball! [queasily] You throw a lovely party ma lady...
Erin: [concerned] Are you having a good time?
Andy: Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?
Erin: Andy you look awful!
Andy: You're four seasons in a day. [heaves] You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- [heaves again] Put if you put on a blue... [stops, is struggling] It's Spring Time in the Rockies!
Erin: Are you alright?
Andy: No! [runs off]

Dwight: [referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.
Jim: That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
Dwight: No, try me.
Pam: Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
Dwight: I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
Jim: Okay... [puts pizza into Dwight's mouth]
Dwight: No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
Pam: What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
Dwight: I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
Jim: You need to stop talking.
Dwight: Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. Sex contracts exist!
Pam: Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
Dwight: Yeah sure, Jim could go see her.
Jim: [unbelievingly] Okay...
Dwight: You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
Jim: I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
Pam: No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela.
Dwight: She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
Pam: The reverse cycling ends tonight! [Pam leaves]
Dwight: [to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please.
Jim: I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
Dwight: What are you doing?
Kevin: [getting under the bed covers] I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!

Andy: [throws up on bed] Puts pillow in front of the puke.
Phyllis: Are you alright?
Andy: Erin likes Gabe.
Phyllis: I know. I thought you two were nice together.
Andy: Do you think that they've ever...
Phyllis: Made love? I don't know.
Andy: Well girls tell each other things right?
Phyllis: I'll see what I can find out.

Daryl: [Michael walks into disarray of people's reactions to the TV going out] Where you been?
Michael: I just went out for a walk.
Daryl: Cable's out.
Michael: What? Really? That stinks!
Gabe: It's still on upstairs.
Michael: What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?
Creed: [receiving message on his phone] Hey! Puck and Finn worked it out, and the solo is now a duet.
Michael: Are you kidding me?
Creed: No.
Michael: Now that's going on?
Kevin: I can't believe we're missing that!
Michael: Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it shot. [hurries out]
Kevin: Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!
Kelly: Good luck Michael!

Phyllis: Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
Erin: Oh, uhm, like three months.
Phyllis: And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
Erin: I don't know.
Phyllis: Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
Erin: [awkwardly] I have to go Phyllis.
Phyllis: Magical...

Pam: [knocking on Angela's car window, Angela is naked inside] Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight!
Angela: What are you doing here?
Pam: I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.
Angela: Are you authorized to do this?
Pam: Yes! I have been so authorized.
Angela: Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead.
Pam: Okay.
Angela: Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
Pam: You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-
Angela: You know what Pam just save it.

Erin: [Michael is outside fixing the cable box] You did this?
Michael: No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.
Erin: Why don't you like him?
Michael: What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
Erin: I care if you like him.
Michael: Why? I'm not your father. [Erin looks sad] All right.
Erin: Okay...
Michael: Go to your room.
Erin: What? [confused]
Michael: Go to your room young lady!
Erin: [slowly getting it] Uhm, I'm not going to my room.
Michael: You listen to me. You listen good. You are are not, to see that boy, anymore.
Erin: You listen to me. You are not to tell me what to do.
Michael: As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.
Erin: I hate your roof!
Michael: Oh do not raise your voice to me!
Erin: I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
Michael: Gahh, I will pull this car over!
Erin: I hate it! I hate your car!

Gabe: See ya Oscar! [Oscar leaves]
Michael: [enters, looks to Gabe] If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl's heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.

Michael: Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl's gonna turn my hair gray.

Gabe: [Andy is leaning over toilet] What happened?
Andy: I accidentally ate some seahorses.
Gabe: How much?
Andy: I didn't know it's powdered, so like four or five, I don't know.
Gabe: I've got just the thing! [leaves, comes back with a synthesizer] This one's called Earth Rise, on the Moon. [music plays]
Andy: That's so beautiful.
Michael: Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
Kevin: My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
Michael: Huh?
Kevin: I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
Michael: Pop quiz.
Kevin: ...What?
Michael: Why is today a special day?
Kevin: I almost died.
Michael: Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...
Ryan: You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
Michael: In business school, Kevin. Business school.
Kevin: Wow.

Ryan: If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid not to do it, right?

Michael: A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.

Michael: Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?
Dwight: "Don't be an idiot." Changed my life.

Dwight: Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing.

Michael: Will they throw their hats, you think?
Ryan: What?
Michael: A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
Ryan: Y-You understand nobody's graduating.
Michael: Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: "May your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... That was a pretty good line.
Ryan: ...It doesn't apply.
Michael: I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey!
Ryan: Quit it!
Michael: We have fun.

Roy: I can't for your art show tonight.
Pam: Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.
Roy: I-I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Pam: Thanks.

Pam: I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.

Roy: Love ya.
Pam: You too.

Jim: Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.

Kelly: I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
Pam: Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.
Kelly: Oh my God. You're so in love now.
Pam: Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
Kelly: Oh, art show!
Pam: I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
Kelly: ...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.

Michael: Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? [runs over, throws frisbee] Whoo!
College Student: ....Dude.

Dwight: ...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]
Pam: Dwight, what are you doing?
Dwight: Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
Karen: Oh my God!
Dwight: BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
Stanley: Goooood bye.
Angela: [on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...

Michael: Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
Ryan: ...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
Michael: I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.

Dwight: We have... a bat... in the office.

Toby: The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.

Angela: Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!

Jim: Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
Dwight: At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
Jim: I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
Dwight: What? What's so wierd?
Jim: The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.

Ryan: And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
Michael: Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.

Dwight: [sighs] This is your job, Halpert.
Jim: Ow!
Karen: Oh, what happened?
Jim: That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
Karen: But Jim, this garlic bread is cold.
Jim: What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
Dwight: No... no. One crisis at a time.

Dwight: If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a "sylvania." Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.

Michael: So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied?

Toby: Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.
Pam: Oh! No, you should go.
Toby: Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.

Michael: Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
Ryan: Michael.
Michael: ...And products!
Ryan: What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
Michael: Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.
Business Student #1: Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?
Michael: We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops]

Karen: Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted.
Jim: Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
Karen: What glare?
Jim: The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.

Dwight: I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.

Dwight: Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
Creed: Sure.
Dwight: --to use sudden violence.
Creed: Okay.
Dwight: Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
Creed: What size?

Business Student #2: What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain?
Michael: ...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back.
Business Student #2: Has anyone ever come back?
Michael: ...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.
Business Student #3: How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger?
Michael: Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?
Business Student #3: ...What?
Michael: Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
Business Student #1: By your own employee's calculation you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years.
Michael: ...Wait, Ryan said that?

Kelly: What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
Creed: Animals can't feel pain.
Kelly: Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
Dwight: Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
Kelly: AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT!
Kevin: [locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!

Michael: Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
Business Student #2: But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?
Michael: David will always beat Goliath.
Business Student #1: But there's five Goliaths, there's... Staples, Officemax...
Michael: Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?
Business Student #1: But in the big picture...
Michael: Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT!

Ryan: ...It wasn't personal.
Michael: Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
Ryan: Pack my--?
Michael: You heard me, pack your things.

Meredith: I really want to come out!
Creed: Good night, Mary Beth!

Jim: So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
Dwight: Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
Jim: Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
Dwight: Goodbye Jim. And good luck.

Dwight: Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.

Pam: ...And it's all from the same series.
Woman: Oh.
Pam: Called 'Impressions.'
Woman: Oh.
Pam: Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
Woman: Maybe one day.
Pam: I hope so.
Woman: Mmm.
Pam: I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you?
Roy: Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?
Pam: Hey, Kenny.
Kenny: Hey Pam.
Roy: How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?

Dwight: Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head]
Meredith: Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
Dwight: Hold still, woman!
Meredith: Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!
Dwight: ...[captures bat in bag] ... You're welcome.

Roy: It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.
Pam: Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home.
Roy: To my place?
Pam: Maybe, I'm a little tired.
Roy: Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.
Pam: Thank you.

Ryan: Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
Michael: Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
Ryan: To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
Michael: A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.

Oscar: You're the one who said we needed more culture.
Gil: This is culture to you?
Oscar: It's her first try.
Gil: Yeah, on Van Gogh's first try, he drew the hands of the peasants.
Oscar: Meaning what?
Gil: Meaning, real art takes courage, okay? And honesty.
Oscar: Well, those aren't Pam's strong points.
Gil: Yeah, exactly. That's why this is... motel art.

Artist: Thanks for coming.
Michael: Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.
Pam: Oh, Michael.
Michael: Wow! You did these... freehand?
Pam: Yep.
Michael: My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] ... How much?
Pam: What do you mean?
Michael: I don't see a... price.
Pam: Um... you wanna buy it?
Michael: Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?
Pam: Uh-huh.
Michael: That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
Pam: [hugs Michael] ... Thank you.
Michael: What?
Pam: Do you have something in your pocket?
Michael: ...Chunky. Do you want half?
Pam: No thank you.
Michael: Okay.

Michael: It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.

Kelly: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
Ryan: It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited.
Kelly: I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
Dwight: [knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.

Dwight: Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.

Dwight: Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you’re in a suicide cult.
Creed: No. No. No. You’re way off on that one.
Dwight: Oh yeah?
Oscar: Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
Jim: Hey guys let’s just all admit it. Ok? Dwight’s better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he’s never, ever going to go back on it right?
Dwight: That’s right Jim.

Darryl: Hey man.
Dwight: [jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.
Darryl: Taking a load off huh?
Dwight: No. Putting a load on more like it.
Darryl: Good luck with that.
Dwight: Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again]

Dwight: [to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums]
Jim: [sees a pole poking out Dwight’s pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet]
Dwight: What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
Jim: Prank! [throws money from Dwight’s wallet on the floor]
Dwight: Oh that’s real creative.
Jim: You know what it’s not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
Dwight: I could, but I just don’t feel like it loser.
Jim: Because you’re sitting?
Dwight: Standing.
Jim: Ok.
Dwight: Don’t!
Jim: Because you’re sitting?
Dwight: Standing.
Jim: You know I have to do this.
Dwight: I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]

Andy: [signing his name] Andrew… Baines… Bernard.
Jim: I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
Andy: Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it’s like taking a test, but I know the answers.
Robert: [loudly knocking on the window] In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. [to Mrs. California] There you are! Honey how on earth could you miss the elevator?
Andy: What was that?
Jim: I don’t know. He wasn’t talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn’t hire his wife.

Ryan: That’s why my foundation – The Dream for a Wish Foundation – is going to put them out of business. They’re not going to know what hit them.
Robert: Everyone. I’d like to introduce my wife Mrs. Robert California. Mrs. California this is everyone.
Susan: Hello. Oh call me Susan please.
Robert: Last night at dinner Susan and I were talking about her returning to work. So she’s here today to see if there’s a good fit. Something tells me it just might work out. This is Andy Bernard the regional manager.
Susan: Hello nice to meet you.
Andy: Hey there. It’s a pleasure.
Robert: Andy would you be so kind as to show Susan around the office. Show her the various departments. Find a place where she’ll shine.
Andy: I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We’re 100 percent staffed up.
Robert: Andy. Let’s see if there’s a good fit first. Then we’ll talk.
Andy: Alright.

Dwight: Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
Darryl: You don’t have to say it if you’re doing it.
Dwight: [laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
Darryl: Uh weight lifting yeah.
Dwight: Well today’s your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute’s Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
Darryl: I’ll take a look.
Dwight: Your path from obesity begins right here!

Darryl: I’ve been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn’t realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.

Dwight: Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.

Andy: Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.
Susan: Well it was really nice to meet you Brian.
Ryan: Actually Ryan.
Susan: Oh, Ryan.

Ryan: Bitttch!

Andy: We will start here at Erinville.
Susan: Hi.
Erin: Hoo-hoo!
Andy: Reception. Your classic one-man operation.
Erin: Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
Andy: I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.
Robert: Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring; wouldn’t you agree Andy?
Andy: I’ll explore exploring it.
Robert: Good. It seems like you have this under control. So I’ll just duck out and run the company for a while.
Andy: Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let ‘er rip. What do you hate about this place?
Jim: Well it’s sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
Dwight: Maybe you do. Hi. I’m Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It’s paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
Andy: Jim?
Jim: Well it’s not that easy. It’s kind of sometimes difficult.
Dwight: It’s the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.
Susan: I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.
Dwight: That is true.
Andy: You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.
Dwight: That’s me.
Andy: Dwight why don’t you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
Dwight: Maybe over a beer after she’s closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].
Susan: Well make that a red wine and I’ll tell you my animal rankings [makes gun click noise back].

Andy: Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they’ve ever been to me. What I wouldn’t give for one of Phyllis’ classic room clearing farts right now.

Dwight: Ready? What do you think?
Darryl: Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
Dwight: You haven’t even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let’s go over membership. I’m going to need the first month’s and the last month’s up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month…
Darryl: Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I’m not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
Dwight: Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]
Darryl: Make a real gym.

Susan: I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping.
Andy: But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.
Susan: Uh I could work in customer service. HR even.
Andy: Those are fully staffed as well.
Robert: Are you telling me that there’s no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands?
Andy: [laughing nervously] Yes.
Robert: I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do.
Andy: Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
Susan: Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there’s no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don’t we just let it go.
Robert: No. Absolutely not. Andrew there must be something you can do. Think.
Andy: There are lots of considerations.
Robert: I would be eternally grateful. It’s not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one.
Andy: Alright. Well then welcome aboard.

Susan: So what happens next?
Andy: We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?
Robert: [on phone] Say hello grandma.
Andy: Hi gam-gam.
Robert: Hold one finger up to Susan. You’ll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, “are you taking your medicine?”
Andy: Are you taking your med-meds?
Robert: Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it. [Robert and Andy hang up phones]
Susan: You didn’t say goodbye to your grandma.
Andy: We promised we’d never say goodbye.

Dwight: Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute’s Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
Oscar: All I need is another gym. As if I don’t have enough drama.
Phyllis: We have a gym at home. It’s called the bedroom.
Oscar: Who’s spotting who? Don’t use the bike in the corner. That’s Bruce’s. Jeremy says…
Angela: Enough Oscar, enough.
Dwight: Kelly?
Kelly: I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.

Dwight: That’s okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.

Toby: Did you bring your passport with you?
Susan: Who walks around with their passport?
Toby: Well, I do. Always ready for adventure.
Susan: Have you had any?
Toby: No.
Andy: [sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.
Oscar: Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
Andy/Oscar: it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
Kevin: How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
Angela: This is all pathetic.
Andy: I am not asking, I am ordering.
Oscar: How mean are we talking about?
Andy: It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.
Erin: Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.

Erin: Here you go. [gives Susan a tiny stapler]
Susan: Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer.
Erin: Well that's a sales desk.
Kevin: Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.

Jim: No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.

Oscar: That's Gerald. [hands phone to Jim]
Jim: Oh, wow. So cute.
Susan: Oh, that is so cute-
Phyllis: [grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
Oscar: Yeah, he's in a ladle.
Erin: That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
Oscar: He did it himself.
Phyllis: Is that ladle stainless or...
Oscar: Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma.
Susan: Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup. [Jim chuckles]
Oscar: It's not that kind of ladle.
Jim: Very cute. [holds out the phone]
Susan: Aw, let me see-
Oscar: [grabs phone] Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.

Susan: I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert.

Susan: Your employees don't seem to be taking to me.
Robert: Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We'll fix this.
Andy: [in robot voice] What is going on?
Robert: [chuckles] Please. Andrew, my wife... has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you'll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night.
Andy: Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you?
Susan: Do you not want me here?
Andy: Why would you say that?
Susan: It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either.
Andy: It's not that, exactly.
Susan: But it is something.
Andy: Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.
Susan: Why would you not want me working here?
Andy: I don't know. [chuckles]
Susan: I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he?
Andy: Yes! The dude is an enigma.
Susan: Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he?
Andy: Ah... [stammers]
Susan: Got it.

Dwight: What do you think you're doing?
Darryl: Getting my sweat on.
Dwight: I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
Darryl: I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
Dwight: I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
Darryl: No.
Dwight: Eight minutes!
Darryl: Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
Dwight: Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
Darryl: It's Lejon Brames.
Dwight: That's what I said.
Darryl: You know, get it right.
Dwight: I know.

Andy: [to Susan] Cameras...
Robert: [enters] Oh, still here. Terrific.
Susan: Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here.
Robert: Well that's a shame.
Andy: It just was one of those things-
Susan: Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.
Robert: Where did this come from? Did Andy say that?
Susan: No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him.
Robert: What's the struggle? He made a great call, hired a great person.
Susan: You sure about that?
Robert: Absolutely.
Susan: No games?
Robert: No games.
Susan: Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me.
Robert: Okay, enough of this. I mean, really, enough. It's gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest.
Susan: Andy?
Andy: Yes?
Susan: Why do you keep looking at my husband?
Robert: Andy, just answer the question.
Andy: No games?
Robert: No games.
Andy: Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, "in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen." [laughs]
Robert: You lying son of a bitch!

Robert: Tell my wife you're lying.
Andy: I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.
Susan: That's not true, is it?
Andy: No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.
Robert: This is preposterous.
Susan: Robert...
Robert: Let's get Jim in here. [Jim shoves out of fram in his chair, Robert looks for Jim] Where's Jim?
Erin: He just rolled out and crawled out.
Robert: Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.

Jim: [to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]

Robert: [sees Jim's abandoned car] That's weird. Well, he's gotta be around here somewhere.

Jim: [shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?
Creed: Okay. What about your friend?
Jim: Oh boy.

Dwight: This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
Darryl: Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
Dwight: First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
Darryl: Okay, I'm not doing that.
Dwight: Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
Gabe: I didn't know Darryl joined.
Darryl: Looks that way.
Gabe: Nice pelvic bowl. Deep.

Robert: Hello Jim. [Jim tries to escape]
Andy: [grabs Jim's leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!

Robert: So I think you know what we want to know.
Jim: Do I?
Robert: Yes.
Jim: [mutters] I know, I do.
Andy: Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness.
Jim: I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
Susan: For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here?
Jim: That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
Andy: [laughs] I think we've got ourselves an answer.
Robert: No.
Andy: That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.
Jim: Perfect!
Susan: Jim...
Jim: Yes?
Susan: Answer the question, please.
Jim: [sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
Robert: All right. Thanks.
Jim: Yes. All right. Great. [leaves]
Andy: Uh...
Robert: Yeah.
Andy: Yep.

Susan: [Robert holds the door, she walks through] Thank you. [leaves]
Robert: [claps Andy's shoulder] Heh.

Susan: Andy.
Andy: Hey, Mrs. California.
Susan: Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today.
Andy: You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.
Susan: Yeah, I thought we really hit it off.
Andy: Yeah.
Susan: Well, different circumstances.
Andy: Yeah.
Susan: Who knows?
Andy: Who knows?
Susan: Maybe after all this settles down...
Andy: Totally.
Susan: It's a date.
Andy: Hmm?

Dwight: You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
Darryl: This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
Dwight: Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
Darryl: Dwight, come back and spot me.
Dwight: All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
Darryl: To push this bar up.
Dwight: No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
Darryl: Help me!
Dwight: What do you want!?!
Darryl: To look good for Val!
Dwight: Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
Ryan: [pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
Pam: Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?
Ryan: Smokey's dead.
Pam: Smokey, the bear?
Ryan: Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
Jim: Wow That's terrible, I really liked him.
Ryan: Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
Jim: Well, I second that emotion.
Ryan: Huh?
Nellie: I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
Ryan: Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, "Tracks of my Tears"?
Nellie: Yeah
Ryan: Um... God, so many, Nellie!
Pam: No, no, no, "Tracks of My Tears" and what else? What are some more? What's one more?
Ryan: Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
Pam: I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
Ryan: Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
Dwight: You don't like the Beatles?
Ryan: That's... That's not the point!
Dwight: Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
Ryan: Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
Oscar: It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Ryan: Okay well, that's a relief!
Jim: Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
Pam: Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!
Jim: Tickets are 250 bucks.
Pam: 250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
Ryan: Yeah... Who's opening?
Jim: Paul Anka.
Ryan: Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
Jim: Okay, you could just show up late though.
Ryan: How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
Pam: Tears of a clown!
Ryan: Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!

Darryl: Looking good, RC!
Robert: Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's?
Angela: Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.

Angela: My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!

Dwight: I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
Jim: Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
Oscar: What's going on?
Dwight: There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
Erin: Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out
Dwight: That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male "hanging out". Call the cops!
Pam: Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
Phyllis: How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
Dwight: I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
Nellie: I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.

Andy: Hey!
Erin: Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
Angela: We think you might kill Robert.
Andy: What?
Kevin: because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
Andy: guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser.
Pam: Oh, great! That sounds good!
Kevin: Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
Andy: Why would that be weird?
Kevin: It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
Erin: Andy's just coming as my date.
Kevin: Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.

Nellie: [hears knocks on door.] Come in!
Darryl: You really re-did Andy's office, huh?
Nellie: Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.
Darryl: I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
Nellie: How are things in the warehouse?
Darryl: You could go downstairs and ask them?
Nellie: The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?
Darryl: Who knew, right?
Nellie: [speechless.] I...

Nellie: Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.

Angela: Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
Andy: Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
Kevin: Oh man, this is weird!
Robert: Andrew. [Robert extends his hand.]
Andy: Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! [hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you!

Andy: [points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!

Kevin: Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
Creed: Well, I don't want to get raped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two!
Kevin: No! It was my idea to not be raped!
Dwight: [Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
Kevin: Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand.
Dwight: You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!

Kevin: So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!

Andy: What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it.
Jim: Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
Andy: The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
Pam: Sounds like you're doing alright.
Andy: Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!

Ryan: Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.

Senator: You know, Oscar, I really had no idea you were so passionate about animals.
Oscar: my dog Gerald is my life.
Senator: really? Well, if you want to get involved, call me. This is my cell. I'm more likely to pick up night, say after 9... Excuse me. [Walks away.]

Oscar: This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.

Robert: [telling story to Nellie.] I stepped in right away and start--
Andy: Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?
Robert: Well...
Andy: You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
Robert: So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure?
Andy: Evil! [chuckles.] although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
Robert: and the hero, who's that based on?
Andy: Me, I guess. [sings.] We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!
Meredith: Hey jabroni. Show some class.
Stanley: She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni
Andy: You're being a Thomas Oregon!
Robert: Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don't you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?
Andy: Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?
Robert: Andy you should leave. Now.
Andy: [to Waiter.] Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.
Waiter: I'm sorry, the tables are sold as complete units.
Andy: then I'll take a table!
Waiter: Okay
Andy: And a high five! [Raises hand, misses high five with waiter.] Oh, let's do this again!

Andy: [waiter is cracking pepper into Andys salad] Oh, yes indeed... When! [Waiter begins walking away.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] When!

Oscar: I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
Pam: Oh my god!
Oscar: I know!
Jim: Wait, what? Come on!
Oscar: We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
Jim: Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
Oscar: Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
Jim: Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
Pam: Whoa!
Jim: What happened, did he do it?
Pam: Are you-- Twice! For real?
Jim: Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
Pam: Life is Downton Abbey.
Jim: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.

Dwight: [on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!

Dwight: It's $475! Like candy from a baby!

Andy: Hey... David Wallace!
David: Andy Bernard!
Andy: Hey, how are you?
David: How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?
Andy: No, got canned last week.
David: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Andy: No, best thing that ever happened to me.
David: That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.
Andy: Yikes!
David: Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!

Nellie: Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
Darryl: Tacos.
Nellie: What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
Darryl: I can go get us some tacos.
Nellie: Brilliant!
Darryl: If you loan me some money.
Nellie: Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?
Darryl: $30.
Nellie: $30, yes!

Nellie: I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!

Oscar: [Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
Jim: Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.]
Oscar: This is interesting.
Pam: Hm-hmm.
Jim: what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Pam: Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
Oscar: He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
Pam: Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
Jim: Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!

Speaker: Before we bring out our guest of honor tonight, we are very proud to introduce a great philanthropist and a great guy. Robert California!
Robert: Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason!
Andy: can you believe this guy?
Robert: The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes! [laughter.]
Andy: Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
Robert: Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. But people don't often adopt older dogs, so Bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else will
Andy: I will! I will take all of those dogs!
Robert: Andy, that's very kind--
Andy: No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.
Robert: Andy why don't we discuss this at a--
Andy: No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. [Points at himself] This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference [grabs dog] thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!
Erin: Oh God!
Senator: Mr. Bernard, right this way.
Andy: Okay! Hope you all learned something!

Vet: Huey is going to need this medication once every 90 minutes. You can administer it orally, but he's going to puke it up. So, other end is best. Don't split up Daisy and Mojo because daisy will start to, uh... I was going to say bark, but it's more of a scream.
Andy: I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.
Vet: Uh, no. Kenny's a therapy dog. He apparently thinks you're in some kind of emotional crisis.
Andy: Stupid dog.

Senator: Well, if you would like to talk about this some more, my office is always open! So here's my office number, and my cell number.
Meredith: Thank you!

Pam: Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar.
Oscar: sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.

Oscar: No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.

Darryl: Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!
Nellie: Oh, great! Okay, oh... Oh, these tacos!
Darryl: Hmhmm.
Nellie: Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!

Darryl: She's trying.

Speaker: The winner of the three day trip to the sky top lodge is Dwight Schrute!
Dwight: [applause] Yes! Thank you!
Speaker: The yearlong membership to Scraton-Bikram Yoga is Dwight Schrute!
Dwight: [applause] Oh yes! Yeah!
Speaker: A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to Dwight Schrute!
Dwight: [applause] Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
Speaker: Well, I think I can save us some time, Dwight Schrute has won every single item here!
Dwight: Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
Speaker: Well, Dwight, yes! You certainly are a record breaker! Your donation is the largest we've ever received at over 34 thousand dollars! [applause]
Jim: Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Dwight: Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]

Senator: Oscar!
Oscar: Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
Senator: It was lovely! And don't forget to call.
Oscar: okay
Senator: thanks so much for coming

Oscar: why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela

Andy: [applying diaper to dog.] so it just goes on under here like this?
Vet: that's right!
Andy: Ugh, oh god!
Vet: Yeah, you never get used to that.
Jim: Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
Andy: I am so great!
Erin: He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
Jim: Look at that one though, he's smiling!
Vet: Yeah, he should be! It's his first day without a muzzle.
Andy: This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
Pam: Absolutely, it's awesome--
Jim: Yes--
Kevin: I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
Andy: You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--
Vet: Maybe you would think it too! [silence.] I'm sorry, it's just I don't get to be in a lot of human conversations.
Jim: Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
Pam: Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
Andy: Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!
Jim: Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
Andy: Yeah, I do. I have that.
Jim: Yeah
Erin: You're going to be alright
Kevin: No. No he's not.
Andy: Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev!
Kevin: You're welcome!

Kevin: Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!

Erin: So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
Darryl: Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
Kevin: My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
Pam: What do you feed her?
Kevin: Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
Darryl: Is she sick? How are her poops?
Kevin: Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
Pam: Does she smell?
Kevin: She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.

Kevin: People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
Jim: [phone ringing] You gonna answer that, Kev?
Kevin: Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!

Jim: Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.

Kevin: Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
Jim: No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
Kevin: Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
Jim: It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
Kevin: Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
Jim: Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]
Kevin: Oh, man!
Andy: It is 1-3-4, Kev! [Kevin runs to the phone]
Jim: Kev, c'mon.
Dwight: Hustle!
Kevin: Hold it.
Andy: You are murdering the Nard-dog!
Kevin: [on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings]
Angela: You're bad at this too!
Kevin: [running to the phone] Just... don't answer that call!
Stanley: Just transfer the damn call.
Kevin: Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings]
Andy: Hey-o! [applauding and cheering]
Dwight: Way to go.

Andy: My maid died.

Pam: Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. [picks up piece of mail] Look, it's official! [door opens, Michael is in a bath robe]
Michael: Oh, good. My hooker's here. [laughs] Hi.
Pam: Michael, you were expecting me, right?
Michael: Yes I was. Yes I was.
Pam: Are you wearing anything under the robe?
Michael: That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.

Pam: This looks great, Michael.
Michael: Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
Pam: Yes, please.
Michael: What shape?
Pam: ... Square is fine.
Michael: Alright.

Charles: Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. [Kelly raises hand] Yeah.
Kelly: Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
Charles: Eh, uh, in a hotel.
Angela: Charles, where were you born?
Charles: Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. [Andy raises hand] Yeah.
Andy: How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.
Charles: Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? [Charles sees Stanley with his crossword, Charles stares and he puts it away] Thank you. So, umm...
Jim: [whispering] Would you please stop that?
Dwight: What?
Jim: You're breathing very heavily.
Dwight: This is how I breathe.
Jim: No it's not.
Dwight: If you want to tell me -
Charles: Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.
Jim: Oh no. I was just -
Charles: No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear "yes".
Jim: ... Yes.
Charles: Good. As I was saying...

Dwight: Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles]

Pam: So, what do you say we get started?
Michael: After breakfast.
Pam: I'm full.
Michael: So how you feeling about the new company?
Pam: I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow.
Michael: You excited? About the new company?
Pam: Yeah. I'm excited to start the company.
Michael: After breakfast.
Pam: We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.
Michael: No, I'm whipping them.
Pam: No, I know you are.
Michael: Just let go.
Pam: Just let me have... Oh.
Michael: Let go, please. Just gimmee -
Pam: Fine! [eggs splatter all over his robe] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Michael: I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.

Phyllis: I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
Stanley: I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
Creed: Oh, he does. He does.

Michael: [doing situps] I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
Pam: You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
Michael: I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.
Pam: I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
Micheal: Whatever calms you down.
Pam: Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
Michael: Don't patronize me, Pam.
Pam: I think you should get dressed.
Michael: I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
Pam: Michael, that seems impossible.
Michael: It's totally impossible!
Pam: We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
Michael: Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
Pam: Great.
Michael: Okay, Ryan.
Pam: No. What? Why?
Michael: He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.
Pam: No. We're not gonna hire Ryan.
Michael: Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.
Pam: Okay.
Michael: He worked at that telemarketing place.
Pam: We'll find him.
Michael: Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
Pam: Really?
Michael: Yeah.
Pam: We have an investor already?
Michael: Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
Pam: Michael, that's fantastic.
Michael: Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'. [sits down in robe, legs spread wide] Umm...
Pam: Hey! We need to get you dressed!

Pam: I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!
Michael: Alright.

Andy: [laughing at something on his computer]
Charles: You a soccer fan?
Andy: Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.
Charles: Well, that makes two of us.
Andy: No way!
Charles: Yeah.

Andy: I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.

Charles: I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
Andy: Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!
Charles: Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.
Andy: Cool!

Jim: I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.

Pam: Next on the list - open the mail.
Michael: Oh. Wow. "Michael Scott Paper Company." Okay. Very official. "Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence."
Pam: No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add "find office"...
Michael: How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
Pam: Next on the list -- song parodies.
Michael: Okay. Okay. "Achey Breaky Fart."
Pam: Great. Let's sing it in the car.
Michael: No! No No. No. "My Stumps." Like "My Humps" but a guy with no legs.
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: We can do this.
Pam: We can do this.

Andy: Whoa! And he just goes, "Boom". [kicking motion] Goal!
Charles: Yep. Yep. That's Pele.
Andy: You know your soccer, man.
Charles: I know. Yes I do.
Stanley: I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
Charles: Oh yeah?
Stanley: From Argentina.
Charles: I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.
Andy: I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...
Charles: What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?
Jim: Uh, no. Nope. Not really.
Charles: Well, it's not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs]
Jim: It's 'cause I'm more of a player.
Charles: Yeah?
Jim: You bet.
Dwight: Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
Jim: Well I do.
Dwight: Wow.
Jim: I play.
Dwight: You can be so modest sometimes.
Jim: Well, maybe you should get back to work.
Dwight: Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
Jim: Maybe we will someday.
Dwight: Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
Charles: That's a great idea, Dwight.
Dwight: Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
Jim: Yeah.
Dwight: I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
Charles: What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
Dwight: Jim, what do you say?
Angela: Sounds fun.
Andy: I'm in it to win.
Dwight: Game on!
Charles: Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.
Jim: Let's... eh... see ya.
Charles: See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait!

Jim: Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.

Pam: [Michael comes out with Vikram, arms raised] We got Vikram!
Vikram: You got me.

Vikram: Where are we going?
Pam: We have a meeting with an investor today.
Michael: Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back. [gets out of the car] Ah, okay.
Vikram: He seems really confident.
Pam: He can be.
Vikram: Confidence. It's the food of the wise man but the liquor of the fool.
Pam: Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.

Michael: Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. [Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It's Michael.
Ryan: I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
Michael: Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.

Vikram: He's taking a long time. Is it possible he's bowling? I mean, you know him better than I do.
Pam: Yes. Yes, it's possible.

Michael: Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
Pam: Michael! What's going on?
Michael: I'm...
Pam: Hey, Ryan.
Ryan: Hey, you.
Michael: Excuse me. Yes?
Pam: This wasn't on the list.
Michael: Yes, it is.
Pam: No.
Michael: Yes.
Pam: It's not.
Michael: It is.
Pam: [looks at list] When did you add this to the list?
Michael: Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
Ryan: Sixty thousand dollars a year.
Pam: You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
Ryan: What do you make, secretary?
Supervisor: Back to work, shoe bitch!
Ryan: I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
Michael: Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
Ryan: What size shoes are you guys?
Michael: Uh, nine.
Ryan: What are those, a men's ten?
Pam: No.
Michael: [Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he's doing.
Pam: What is he doing?
Michael: He's stealing them. Okay, okay.
Pam: Oh my God.
Michael: He's already paying for himself.
Pam: Sorry!

Ryan: Where is it?
Michael: Right here.
Vikram: Hey, c'mon, guys. These are prime selling hours, you know.

Charles: Miner - [kicking a piece of trash]
Jim: Oh, there he goes.
Charles: ...sees his partner -
Jim: Yikes.
Charles: Halpert. He looks up!
Jim: Aw, man.
Charles: Defending duo! He sets him up! [Jim moves the piece of trash with his hands] He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!
Jim: Oh! Goal!
Charles: Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you.
Jim: Aw, it's gonna be the [softly] worst.

Ryan: Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
Michael: Oh yeah.
Pam: Sure.
Ryan: It was indescribable.
Michael: Sounds awesome.
Pam: Beat.

Vikram: What sort of investing club is this?
Michal: Vikram, you ask a lot of questions and I like that. Hey, Nana! Hi!
Pam: [mouthing to camera] Nana?
Nana: Michael!

Michael: People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.

Michael: Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! [snaps in front of sleeping old man] I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.
Nana: So let's hear it.
Michael: Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
Nana: How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy?
Michael: By wanting it more. By working hard-
Nana: What's your mission statement?
Michael: Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.

Charles: C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?
Dwight: Wing.
Kevin: Wag.
Charles: Jim. What do you play?
Jim: Left.
Charles: Forward or half?
Jim: Forward, definitely.
Chares: Okay, striker, huh?
Jim: Striker!
Charles: Let's see what you got in those legs!
Jim: Alright! Let's do it.
Charles: Alright. [Dwight blows whistle in Jim's face] No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff.
Jim: Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]

Michael: And I offer same day, free delivery.
Nana: Michael, I don't know about this.
Michael: Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
Nana: I'm not so sure.
Michael: Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
Nana: See, this is what concerns me.
Old Woman: We could just give him a chance. It's not much money.
Michael: Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
Nana: This isn't a handout club. It's an investment club!
Michael: Okay.
Nana: I love you, Michael. I do.
Michael: Okay.
Nana: But no. I mean it. No.

Vikram: I thought Nana raised some good questions. What kind of a name is Nana?
Pam: It means grandmother.
Vikram: Oh, sweet Jesus. Look, I'm sorry to do this, but can you drop me back at the telemarketing building?

Vikram: You know, Michael? You want to succeed? You got to apply the same- [Michael slams door]

Andy: Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim. [Charles kicks, ball hits Phyllis in the nose]
Charles: Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?
Oscar: Phyllis, Phyllis.
Charles: Phyllis, are you okay? Are, you okay?
Phyllis: [muffled] No, I swallowed a crown.
Charles: Why'd you duck, Jim?
Jim: What?
Dwight: Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
Jim: Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
Charles: Does that make you feel better? Huh?
Jim: I'm sorry, Phyllis.
Charles: Oh, yeah. Jim's sorry.

Ryan: Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
Michael: Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.
Pam: I can't do this.
Michael: What's that?
Pam: I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
Michael: Blech.
Pam: I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
Michael: Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.
Pam: We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
Michael: Well we should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay...
Pam: How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!
Michael: I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? [Pam nods]

Michael: You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.

Michael: I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up. She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.

Michael: [walks into room] Okay.
Pam: I could work here. I could see this.
Michael: It's right in the middle of the paper belt.
Pam: Are you good?
Michael: Yeah, I'm good. You good?
Pam: I'm good.

Michael: You know what they say, keep your friends close. [pointing to office sign where "Dunder Mifflin" is listed right above "Michael Scott Pap"]
Charles: Michael, you're back.
Michael: Yes, I am, Charles.
Charles: Mmmhmm.
Michael: Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. [Pam and Michael stare him down, he walks away] Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
Pam: Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
Angela: So cute.
Oscar: Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.

Pam: Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
Angela: News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
Pam: Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course.
Angela: That is where we disagree.

Oscar: Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?
Pam: No, three-month-old humans don't do that.
Angela: My Phillip is crawling.

Pam: Angela is such a liar!
Oscar: It's maddening!

Oscar: Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
Pam: Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again.

Angela: No one said "you must have two"
Oscar: Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
Angela: No thank you.

Andy: [laughing] Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat…am i right?

Angela/Pam: Unbelievable!
Oscar: Un-be-liev-a-ble.

Nellie: It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it?
Packer: That's great.
Dwight: Pretty good.
Nellie: Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP.
Dwight: [laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
Nellie: I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more.
Dwight: Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
Jim: Catching butterflies.
Dwight: That's a hobby, unless it's for food.
Jim: Theater.
Dwight: Waste of time.
Jim: Dragging.
Dwight: That's just a verb.
Jim: Dragging sticks.
Dwight: Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.
Nellie: Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just… you three, no.
Packer: Not good enough (clicks tongue)

Dwight: English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. [British accent] You're crap. You're wonderful. [back to American] They're mean, but they're incisive.

Nellie: Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory.
Packer: I'll be there at 6:00
Cathy: Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real 'Talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about.
Jim: 'Talla-nasty', very clever.
Cathy: Thank you-
Gabe: Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' [chuckles] no, no, no, no…

Jim: Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
Stanley: My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'Jim Face']. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?

Andy: Okay, everybody. 5:00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring 'em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!
Pam: Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!
Andy: Say what?
Pam: We are good to goooo!
Andy: Say what?
Pam: We're good to goooo!
Angela: Stop it.
Andy: Say-
Angela: Stop it.
Oscar: Andy.

Andy: Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
Pam: Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.
Andy: …ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.

Packer: Jason Bourne would kick Bond's ass.
Nellie: Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.
Dwight: Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children … What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
Packer: Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips.
Dwight: That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
Gabe: What happens if you're the hunchback?
Dwight: Oh, you get kicked.
Jim: How many buttons do you have?
Dwight: (takes out bag) 40. Always.
Cathy: Can I see?
Dwight: Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy)
Cathy: So, I get to kick you now.
Dwight: No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
Cathy: Well, that's how I played it in college.
Jim: College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
Dwight: Aah!
Packer: Aaaaand he host at his own lame game.
Nellie: Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit.
Packer: Thank you.
(Dwight looks on angrily)

Ryan: I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
Erin: And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
Waitress: Sorry, no waffles.
Erin: Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
Ryan: A waffle?
Erin: A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
Ryan: No.
Erin: I'm moving down here, you know.
Ryan: Oh, no, I didn't know.
Erin: I'm young, and I can … and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
Ryan: You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.

Ryan: Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
Erin: Hey.

Pam: Watson carpet and tile.
Kevin: One order.
Oscar: Order reference number 00983-126.
Phyllis: Eight Cases, bright white inkjet.
Angela: Paid.
Kelly: I'm dying!
Darryl: Processed.
Val: And delivered.

Kelly: Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.

Nellie: I will be right back.
Packer: I will be here.
Dwight: Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
Packer: Oh, please, You're through. She's going to give it to me as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle. [clicks tongue, whinnies]
Dwight: Well, saddles… [clicks tongue, whinnies] … sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
Packer: What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me.

Dwight: If anyone's having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.

Andy: Who is ready for dinner? "oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid". No. [claps] I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves… [takes foil off tray] [Jamaican accent] A Jamaican feast, mon!
[Disapproval from everyone else]
Phyllis: If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
Andy: Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!
Val: Hey.
Brandon: How you doing, Val? [Val and Brandon kiss]
Oscar: Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
Brandon: Oh no, I'm not actually Jamaican.
Oscar: Terrific.
Darryl: What's up man? I'm Darryl.
Brandon: Darryl, I heard about you. You doing good?
Darryl: Oh yeah.
Brandon: Must be doing real good since you're f***ing my girlfriend.
Everyone: Whoa.
Kevin: Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
Darryl: I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend.
Val: Brandon, what the hell are you talking about?
Brandon: Don't play dumb with me. I know what's up.
Val: Honey, I am not sleeping with-
Andy: Heyyy… let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!
Brandon: Hope you all like goat.
Andy: Goat…

Nellie: Blow in my ear.
Packer: Alright.
Nellie: Like I'm on the beach.
[Packer blows in Nellie's ear]
Dwight: [imitates seagull calls] Seagull. [Continues seagull calls]
Nellie: And a wave crashing… a wave crashing.
[Packer and Dwight imitate waves]
Nellie: Oh, that is lovely.
Jim: Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.

[Cathy knocks on Jim's door and Jim answers]
Jim: Hey, how's it going?
Cathy: Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here?
Jim: Uh… yeah, I'm just watching basketball.
Cathy: Okay, yeah.
Jim: Okay.
Cathy: Cool… [Jumps onto bed] Is this March Madness? I love March Madness.
Jim: Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in… March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so… [sits on floor]
Cathy: LeBron James.
Jim: Yes, nice. Good word association
Cathy: [giggles]
[Cathy walks over to mini fridge and bends over to take something out. Jim looks away]

[Packer takes string out of his mouth]
Nellie: Impressive.
Dwight: Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it [puts string in his mouth]

Andy: Thornwood Wholesalers.
Kevin: One order.
Brandon: I read the text you sent to Val, man.
Val: That's messed up.
Angela: Is this spicy?
Brandon: No, baby girl. It would be messed up if I didn't find anything, but I did, so-
Andy: I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.
Brandon: At midnight?
Andy: … yeah…
Kevin: It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery…
Kelly: Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
Andy: Thank you.
Kelly: I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
Andy: Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?
Kelly: No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.

[Knock at the door]
Jim: Yup, coming. [opens door] All right.
Stanley: My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
Jim: We have plenty.
Stanley: Oh, hello. [laughs with Cathy]
Jim: Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
Stanley: Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
Jim: No, no, no, Stanley.
Stanley: mm-hmm. [about to leave]
Jim: Stanley. Stanley.
Stanley: uh-huh.
Jim: Stanley. Uhh… you know what? Just bring back those bottles!

Erin: Whoa. the lights are still on.
Ryan: Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
Erin: I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Ryan: Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
Erin: [gasps] Hello, waffle iron.
Ryan: Hello, what do we have here?
Erin: Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl…
Ryan: Right.
Erin: … a measuring cup…
Ryan: Got that. [Metallic thud] Get down.
Erin: [whispers] It's the fuzz!
Ryan: [whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.

Darryl: "I got too much ice cream. You want some?" "Getting' my fry on."
Kelly: Boring.
Darryl: Uh, "The moon is huge tonight."
Phyllis: Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
Darryl: That's regular text talk.
Brandon: You forgot one.
Darryl: "You're such a great friend."
Brandon: With the dots.
Darryl: "You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot."
Kelly: Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means "Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
Everyone: Oh…
Brandon: See? Yes. Thank you, sister.
Val: Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right?
Darryl: Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.

Nellie: You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
Dwight: You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] …ahhmmm… excuse me… What?! Not now, I'm busy.
Jim: [on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
Dwight: Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no… Freak, I need a favor.
Gabe: Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.
Dwight: I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
Gabe: What's in it for GSL?
Dwight: You really want Packer as your boss?
Gabe: Got it.

Dwight: If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.

Dwight: Where did you see it?
Jim: In the bed.
Cathy: I haven't seen anything.
Dwight: We gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed]
Cathy: Jeez…
Dwight: Describe it.
Jim: Brown, shiny, painful bite.
Dwight: Could be a bat weevil… Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
Jim: Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
Dwight: Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
Jim: So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
Dwight: Pshh. That's a bedbug.
Jim: Yeah.
Dwight: Everything's a joke.
Jim: I know.
Dwight: Check your hair! [checks Jim's hair]
Jim: Ow.
Dwight: God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
Jim: Just check it.
Dwight: You are clean. Okay… One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh]
Jim: Alright.
Dwight: Yeah. [jumps into bed] Cover me!
Cathy: Is this really nessecary?
Jim: He knows what he's doing.
Dwight: Let the bedbugs bite!
Cathy: Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower.
Jim: Alright, then I will catch you later… What do we do now?
Dwight: We wait. [Shower starts] Come to papa.
Jim: Oh.

[Packer and Nellie are speaking softly to each other. Gabe sprays his inhaler into Packer's drink.]
Jim: I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
Dwight: Nope, I wasn't bitten.
Jim: Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
Dwight: Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
Jim: Come on.
Dwight: If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.
Jim: You know what? Maybe they just ate.
Dwight: No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
Jim: Okay, they're fine. They're adults.
Dwight: No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
Jim: Is that really how you want to get this job?
Dwight: Such a chorus girl.
Jim: Okay, Dwight… Dwight… Dwight, Dwight Dwight!… uh…
Cathy: [in a bathrobe] Is crazy gone?
[Jim does his signature face]

[Nellie and Packer are dancing. Gabe winks at Dwight. Packer pukes all over Gabe's slacks and walks off.]
Nellie: Oh!
Gabe: They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore!
Dwight: Euughh… Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present… Hey.

Cathy: Yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster… Okay, cool. Thanks… I know, I'm a pig, right?
Jim: Hmm? No.
Cathy: [giggles] Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously.
Jim: Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
Cathy: Oh my God, what are you thinking?
Jim: um… I mean-
Cathy: I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me?
Jim: I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
Cathy: Can you… without running to the other side of the room all night?
Jim: Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just… we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
Cathy: Okay. [Sits next to Jim.] I am so cold.
Jim: [Jim Face]

Pam: Hey, Darryl. You okay?
Darryl: She's got a boyfriend.
Andy: Play it cool, man. She'll come around.
Pam: No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there.
Andy: Yeah, but… My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.
Pam: My husband would tell you to go for it.

Ryan: Hey.
Erin: Hey.
Ryan: Hey.
Erin: Hey.
Ryan: Hey, this is fun.
Erin: A lot of fun.
Ryan: I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
Erin: You should move down here with me.
Ryan: Yeah?
Erin: We could be roommates.
Ryan: Really?
Erin: We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
Ryan: Yeah.
Erin: Maybe in six months-
Ryan: [louder] Six months?… um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.

Nellie: Put your forehead near mine, and see if you can read my thoughts.
Dwight: Okay… Seven, one, one, nine…
Nellie: No, no, no, not numbers, no.
Dwight: No, okay.
Nellie: No.
Dwight: Try again… Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one… is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
Nellie: Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
Dwight: [gasps]Wait, the numbers!
Nellie: Mm-hmm.
Dwight: oh…
Nellie: mm-hmm…
Dwight: There you go.
Nellie: I will see you in seven-
Dwight: Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]… Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie]
Dwight: [in voiceover] Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.

Angela: 1434-967, paid.
Darryl: It has been processed.
Val: It has been delivered.
Pam: That's it, last one.
[Everyone applauds]
Kelly: Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
Andy: Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee…
Phyllis: No way.
Andy: I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion…
Val: Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?
Darryl: Sure.
Val: Okay, thanks.
Darryl: Hey, just so you know, me and you… I don't think that's ridiculous… Dot, dot, dot… dot, dot.

[Jim walks into his room to find a bathrobe on the floor]
Jim: All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
Cathy: What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right?
Jim: Cathy, go.
Dwight: [wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug?
Jim: Awesome.
Dwight: [sprays the bed and Cathy] Stand back!
Cathy: Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?!
Dwight: [continues spraying the bed] It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
Cathy: [coughs and moans]
Jim: Right there! [points to Cathy]
Cathy: Oh stop it, stop it, stop it!
Jim: [coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
Cathy: I can't breathe!
Dwight: I think I saw it!
Cathy: Stop it! [runs out the door]
Jim: Nice job, I think you got 'em.
Dwight: You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.
Jim: [Jim face]

Dwight: Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.
Jim: Oh yeah? What's the first best?
Nellie: [at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight?
Jim: [whispers] Is that Nellie?
Dwight: [whispers] Don't let-shh!
Nellie: Are you in there? I can see the light on under your door. Hello? [knocks] [Dwight turns off the lights] Oh, look at that. The light went off, just as I said the light went on. Hello? [knocks] Dwight? [whispers] Dwight. [Dwight eats his Bananas Foster]
Gabe: Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
Dwight: Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don’t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.

Gabe: I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They’d flex them all night at the discotheque.
Dwight: Oh, I bet you think it’s all about core, huh?
Gabe: Yeah.
Dwight: Oh, please.
Gabe: Core’s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One – lengthen. Two – elongate.
Jim: Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who’s the strongest? Well, there’s only one way to solve that – flat curl contest.

Jim: All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
Dwight: Feast on this, Lewis.
Gabe: I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
Jim: Come on, Gabe, you can’t handle his hamstrings. You’re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
Gabe: Speed set. One. Two.
Jim: Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
Dwight: Oh, thank you.
Jim: You’re welcome.
Gabe: Five. Six.
Jim: Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
All: Eight, nine, ten.
Gabe: We got it?

Dwight: Very funny Jim.
Gabe: Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
Robert: Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over]
Jim: All right, easy there, grandpa.
Dwight: I don’t need your help.
Jim: Okay. You don’t need my help?
Dwight: Here, here… Just…

Andy: Morning.
Erin: Hey.
Andy: Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot… these.
Erin: Oh.
Andy: You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
Erin: Andy, if you’re gonna hang out for a while, uh…
Andy: What’s this?
Erin: This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
Andy: Is this Robert’s attempt to embarrass me?
Erin: No, of course not. It’s just – I think it’s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it’s like, where does it end? So just… [puts visitors tag on Andy]

Andy: Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they’re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it’s a little much? …Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that’s what it feels like.

Jim: All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
Dwight: Good, we have a deal?
Jim: Thanks Janet.
Dwight: Thanks so much Earl.
Jim: Wow, simultaneous sale.
Dwight: And they said it couldn’t be done. Boom!
Jim: Screw ‘em.
Andy: Lot going on guys. What’s happening?
Jim: Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Andy: That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It’s like a festival of poo.
Jim: Hey, hey, come on, language.
Dwight: Yeah, and we’re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
Jim: In the fridge.
Dwight: No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
Jim: Sorry, man, I can’t focus on zingers. There’s too many potential clients.
Stanley: You two better watch yourselves.
Phyllis: Yeah, the Syracuse branch can’t be happy you’re taking New York clients.
Robert: Shh… shh… [vomits in trash can]
Jim: Robert?
Oscar: Why did Binghamton close?
Robert: Can everyone just, please… I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and – how should I say this – Columbian whites. What – what is this about, uh, Binghamton?
Kevin: The branch closed. Forever.

Robert: Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I’m not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.

Nellie: I got your voicemail. From – from last night.
Robert: Wonderful.
Nellie: And the answer… is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]
Robert: Pam, when’s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn’t hold the memories in?
Pam: Oh, it was this summer –
Robert: Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.
Pam: Um, I am a little busy.
Robert: Yes, ‘course. Why don’t you list the things that would keep you from helping me.
Pam: Yeah, I can make you a list.
Robert: Let’s do it now. What’s number one?
Pam: Why don’t I help you now?
Robert: There we go.
Pam: Okay.

[Andy cooking food by reception, Harry walks in]
Harry: Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute?
Erin: Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?
Dwight: And you are…
Harry: Harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.
[shocked look from Jim]
Harry: What the hell’s all this?
Andy: Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.
Harry: You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one’s that guy?

Jim: The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
Dwight: Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to – how do I put this – steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
Jim: Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
Dwight: Yes.
Jim: Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]

Dwight: [pointing at Toby] There he is. That’s Lloyd.
Toby: Me?
Creed: Yeah, you.

Harry: Where do you get off crossing state lines?
Toby: Now, we’re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.

Toby: I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn’t back down from anybody. And he calls people “Kimosabe”.

Harry: They’re New York. We’re New York. State line is the dividing line. That's the way it’s always been.
Jim: There’s actually not a rule that says that.
Dwight: That’s true.
Toby: That’s true. There’s no rule. You can check the employee handbook.
Harry: Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
Toby: No.
Dwight: Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could’ve choked so many people by now.
Harry: Stay out of my state. It’s in your best interest to stay out of my state.
Toby: I’ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
Harry: Just stay out of New York, Lloyd.
Toby: Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]
Jim: How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
Harry: Robert’s here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don’t think we were doing that.
Dwight: Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim’s leg.

Robert: Where’s the Advil, Jim? I think I’ve hit my limit on the Tylenol – Oh.
Andy: [Doing dishes] Sorry, not Jim.
Robert: Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?
Andy: Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
Robert: Oh, for god –
Harry: Robert California. What a surprise you’re here in Scranton.
Robert: Harry…
Harry: So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place?
Robert: How do you mean?
Andy: I forgot, a… a pan, uh –
Harry: No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.
Robert: Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There’s no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems… so poorly timed.
Dwight: Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
Harry: Listen, Robert, I don’t have time. There’s a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions –
Dwight: Don’t listen to him.
Harry: Used to be Binghamton’s –
Dwight: Nope.
Harry: I want it, it’s mine.
Dwight: Prestige is ours. Okay, they’re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
Harry: We need you to make a decision.
Dwight: Make a decision.
Robert: I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said… [Andy walks out]

Andy: Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. [walking to car] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.

Robert: Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? [camera pans to right, Harry, Dwight, and Jim watching Robert in conference room] They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I’ll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one.

Harry: Is it just me or is our boss a freakin’ weirdo? [stands up, walks outside] I’m gonna get some air.
Dwight: Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
Jim: [Gets up and looks out Nellie’s office window] He’s running!
Dwight: Damn it!
Jim: Damn it.

Dwight: Wha – what is this supposed to be?
Jim: It’s a monkey.
Dwight: Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It’s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
Jim: Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
Dwight: What?
Jim: Is that him?
Dwight: It’s him! Do something! Get out!
Jim: What? What am I gonna do? I don’t –
Dwight: Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That’s it? Oh, that’s great. That’s like a five second delay.
Jim: Dwight!
Dwight: Come on, let’s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
Jim: Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
Dwight: Yeah.
Jim: Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
Dwight: Hit the nos.
Jim: Are you sure?
Dwight: Yes.
Jim: Brace yourself. 3… 2…
Dwight: Got it. Go.
Jim: 1. Here we go! [turns on wipers]

Andy: Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.
Receptionist: Oh, do you have an appointment?
Andy: No, I do not.
Receptionist: Okay, I think I can squeeze you in.
Andy: Seriously? ‘Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
Receptionist: He’s really not that busy.
Mr. Ramish: Is there someone here to see me?
Receptionist: Yes, this man.
Mr. Ramish: Come on in. [Andy walks in]

Pam: So…what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
Nellie: Oh. Oh, I’ll tell you what he does.
Angela:: [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don’t worry, I won’t lay an egg.

Angela:: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]

Angela:: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
Gabe: Did someone say girl talk?

Gabe: Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.

Gabe: Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I’m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.
Nellie: Do you think I’d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
Gabe: Uh, I think you’re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It’ll be upsetting if you don’t.

Andy: I’m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
Mr. Ramish: Why haven’t I heard of you? You got any references?
Andy: No. I’m a rogue.
Mr. Ramish: Uh-huh.
Andy: Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now… [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
Mr. Ramish: Every salesman I’ve ever met has given me his personal phone number.
Andy: Of course they have. Which is why I’m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need – anytime, night or day – you just stop on by.
Mr. Ramish: You want me to drive to your house if I need paper.
Andy: Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe… you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.

Dwight: Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
Dwight: [Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator]
Jim: You all right?
Dwight: Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.
Jim: Ah! [Harry walks in]
Jim: [Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
Dwight: Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!
Jim: What are you talking about?
Dwight: Just run! Take the stairs!
Jim: I don’t even know where the stairs are!
Dwight: I’ll stall him. Go!
Jim: God!
Harry: [Dwight jumping] What are you doing?
Dwight: I’m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We’ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.
Jim: What?
Dwight: My pants fell down! I don’t have a belt!

Dwight: [walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Mr. Ramish: What’s going on?
Dwight: Well –
Harry: Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse –
Dwight: I was here first.
Mr. Ramish: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.
Dwight: I already made an appointment… with your secretary.
Mr. Ramish: Let me stop you all right here. I’ve already picked a new paper supplier.
Dwight: Wait, it’s not D.M Utica, is it?
Mr. Ramish: No, no, it’s not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. It’s… Big Red Paper Company.
Jim: Big Red Paper Company?
Mr. Ramish: Mm-hmm.

Andy: Yes, yes, yes!

Harry: Give me a cup of coffee.
Dwight: Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
Jim: All right, guys. It didn’t work out for any of us, so… we’re still on the same team. Let me get these.
Dwight: No. Let him get his own. It’s Syracuse money.
Harry: You know, your partner’s got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?
Dwight: Jim couldn’t land me in a thousand years.
Jim: But you’re saying there’s a chance.
Dwight: Shut up.

Pam: [Walks into conference room] Hey.
Robert: Hmm.
Pam: I stole Nellie’s phone.
Robert: Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.
Pam: What do you want from me?
Robert: Now we get to the bottom of Nellie’s “yes, yes, yes, yes, never.”
Phone: Hi, Nell, it’s mom. Do keep your chin up. It can’t be as bad as you described.
Robert: Oh yes it can.
Phone: This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections.
Robert: Shopaholic.
Pam: Sounds like it.
Robert: Yeah.
Phone: Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you?
Robert: Ah.
Phone: This is Annie from second nests. I’m sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, we’re gonna hold out for that.
Pam: Okay, that’s enough. [grabs phone]
Robert: Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.
Pam: No, no, no!
Robert: No, come on.
Pam: Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They’re all deleted.
Robert: Pam, Pam, you’ve completely bungled this!
Pam: Ah. Ahh. [walks out]

Pam: Hey.
Nellie: Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
Pam: Um… yes. Definitely. With your hair –
Nellie: Oh!
Pam: Certainly. Um… you dropped your cell phone.
Nellie: Oh, gosh.
Pam: Yep.
Nellie: Thank you. I’m… so stupid.
Pam: No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
Nellie: Oh, god, Pam. Don’t get me started.
Pam: No, I will not.
Nellie: You’ve just got me started. Robert… is… a filthy beast. I mean, don’t you get the feeling, he’s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
Pam: Well –
Nellie: I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.
Pam: But sometimes he talks about flesh… and bacchanals.
Nellie: I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
Pam: No… don’t. Just put it out of your mind.
Nellie: Pam, what is your address? I’m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don’t –
Nellie: Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.

Nellie: Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And… I have a new friend. A friend. At work.

Robert: [Erin opens door] Erin.
Erin: There’s a call for you on line one.
Robert: Who is it?
Erin: He says salvation. No last name.
Robert: Yeah, hello?
Andy: [in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don’t, and I will find another buyer.
Robert: You’re blackmailing me.
Andy: It’s just business.
Robert: Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You’re gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don’t even know my real name. I’m the *bleep* lizard king. [disconnects]
Andy: Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]
David: [opens door] Andy Bernard.
Andy: You got a minute?
David: Um… I’m in the middle of a piano lesson.
Andy: I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
David: Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Now… why would I want that? It’s worth half of what it was three years ago.
Andy: Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
David: Why don’t you come in? [Andy walks in, closes door]

Harry: So what would you do if you weren’t selling paper?
Jim: Oh, man, I’d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
Dwight: What?
Jim: Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
Dwight: How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don’t even care about nationals.
Harry: Nothing?
Jim: I don’t know. I’ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
Harry: I’d like to sell one big thing, you know? Like… a plane. One sale, I’m out.
Jim: That sounds lovely.
Harry: Anyway, Robert’s gonna run this company into the ground, so… We won’t be doing this in six months.
Michael: It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company. [tries to parallel park, hits car.] Okay. Not gonna make this one. [drives away revealing plenty of space for the Cruiser]

Jim: LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair]
Pam: Morning Michael!
Michael: Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! [awkwardly climbs out of his car]

Michael: I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. [nips mylar ribbon with hedge clippers, it won't cut, he tears it down] Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!

Kelly: So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
Jim: You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
Kelly: And...
Charles: Hey Kelly?
Kelly: Yes? Charles, you wanted me?
Charles: Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]

Jim: The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says "You wanted me" enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.

Charles: Oh, and Kelly...
Kelly: Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?
Charles: Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
Erin: If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Charles: Erin. Okay, that's very pretty.
Kelly: Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Kevin: I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?

Michael: We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
Pam: What should we do now?
Michael: We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.

Michael: I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.

Michael: I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.]

Pam: I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.

Andy: What do you think?
Dwight: Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
Andy: Thank you!

Dwight: Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much. But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.

Ryan: You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
Michael: Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
Ryan: Please don't listen to my phone calls. Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.

Charles: Hey Jim can I get a, um-
Jim: Hi! [Awkward]
Charles: Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
Jim: Sure!
Charles: Yeah.
Jim: Okay.

Jim: What the hell's a rundown?

Jim: When did you need that rundown by?
Charles: As soon as possible.
Jim: Okay.
Charles: Just get it right.
Jim: Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?

Erin: Oh.
Dwight: You know there's a ghost in this office
Erin: Really?
Dwight: A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
Erin: Why was she in this building?
Dwight: Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
Erin: That's crazy.
Dwight: Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
Erin: Oh my god!
Dwight: It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
Erin: Hmm.
Dwight: That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next. [Taps her shoulder]
Erin: Oh! [Dwight and Erin laugh.]
Dwight: Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
Erin: Yeah.
Dwight: Yeah?
Erin: Just got some ice.
Dwight: Erin [eerie voice] Erin...
Andy: Oh, this is awkward. [Andy and Erin 'dance' trying to get out of each other's way]
Erin: Oops!
Andy: Uh oh! Oh! Oh! [Andy improvs musical verbage]
Erin: So I'll see you guys around!
Dwight: Hey buddy.

Michael: Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before?
Ryan: Pam's better at that stuff
Pam: That is so insulting.
Ryan: How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
Pam: Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
Ryan: I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not saying one is better than the other.
Pam: Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
Ryan: What the hell? [Michael closed his laptop]
Michael: Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.
Ryan: Yeah I make originals too.
Pam: Shut up!
Michael: Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
Pam: Really!
Ryan: Yeah!
Toby: Not much? What's up with you? [from bathroom above] Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. [sound of pissing] Hey does blue go with tan?
Michael: Would someone just make the copy?
Toby: I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
Michael: Just make that copy okay?

Pam: Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
Ryan: That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
Pam: I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
Ryan: You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
Pam: Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
Ryan: This is from the sun.
Pam: Oh yeah I bet.
Michael: They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
Pam: Michael, we can hear you.
Michael: I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.
Pam: Okay it's my turn.
Ryan: No don't take that, give that back!
Pam: Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
Ryan: I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.
Pam: You're gonna make another "spreadsheet."
Ryan: Yeah!
Pam: Yeah exactly. It's my turn.
Ryan: Go make a copy, secretary.
Pam: Come on! Ryan!

Michael: They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?

Dwight: Hey buddy, what are you up to?
Andy: Um, nerthing?
Dwight: Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
Andy: Pffft.
Dwight: Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
Andy: The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
Dwight: And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
Andy: No, that's ridiculous.
Dwight: No no no.
Andy: Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
Dwight: Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.

Michael: Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
Pam: Definitely.
Michael: Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
Pam: We could work from home.
Ryan: Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
Michael: Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right? 1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
Pam: .... Corner idea?
Michael: No, you're supposed to say, "Rock the house."
Ryan: Rock the house!
Pam: How would we know that?

Jim: Hey dude, you know what a "rundown" is?
Oscar: Use it in a sentence.
Jim: "Uh, can you get this rundown for me?" [impersonating Charles]
Oscar: Try another sentence.
Jim: "This rundown better be really good"?
Oscar: I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
Jim: Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
Oscar: Why don't you just ask him--
Jim: No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
Oscar: What have you been doing?
Kevin: Try it in another sentence.

Ryan: Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, "Hey cop, you like donuts?" then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.

Michael: That's my corner.
Pam: I thought that was your corner.
Michael: No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
Pam: So my corner's the one with the copier?
Michael: Pam, I don't make the rules. [Pam walks out.]
Ryan: Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.

Charles: You started on that rundown yet? [Looks at Jim's screen.]
Jim: Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
Charles: Oh.
Jim: I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
Charles: Okay, great.
Jim: Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
Charles: Just keep it simple.
Jim: Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
Charles: You're working hard? On this?
Jim: No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
Charles: Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
Jim: No, I....

Erin: Can I help you?
Pam: No thanks.
Jim: Hey!
Pam: Hey I'm here to see Charles.
Jim: Okay.
Pam: Hey Charles.
Charles: Hey Pam.
Pam: I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.
Charles: I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken.
Pam: Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
Charles: Um.
Pam: Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
Charles: Yeah I know.
Pam: Personal shopper?
Charles: No.
Pam: Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.
Charles: Okay.

Pam: I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.

Michael: Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
Stanley: I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
Phyllis: It's really cute.
Michael: Thank you. You remember Ryan [Stanley laughs deeply] And Pam is around here somewhere.
Stanley: She's upstairs talking to Charles.
Michael: What for?
Stanley: I don't know. [They shrug and leave.]
Ryan: Are we staying til five?
Michael: Yes.

Michael: Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em.

Michael: Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. [Flips a pancake. It's about 8x11 inches] Young sir, would you like a free pancake?
Ryan: I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
Michael: Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.
Michael: Hey Pam.
Pam: Hey.
Michael: You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
Pam: Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
Michael: Yeah?
Pam: That's as specific as I'd like to be.
Michael: Well, at least you're still being honest with me.

Jim: There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
Charles: Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
Jim: Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
Charles: Do I need to?
Jim: No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
Charles: What's that?
Jim: The one I have. I'll use the one I have.

Jim: Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.

Pam: We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves.
Man: Do you have a card?
Pam: Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.

Creed: These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
Michael: These are shaped like paper.
Creed: Well I don't even want these. [Takes the rectangle pancakes out of his coat.]
Meredith: I'll take them for my kid.

Erin: Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
Dwight: You're good.
Erin: Thank you.
Andy: That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like [Andy plays Country Roads on his banjo.]
Erin: Wow!
Andy: What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.
Dwight: Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
Andy: Really?
[Dwight plays a hearty strum of the song, Andy stands and starts a banjo solo]
Dwight: Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
Dwight and Erin: West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River [Andy vocalizes]
Dwight: In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
Dwight and Andy: Take me home, country roads, to the place, I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads. [Erin leaves]
Dwight: Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
Toby: You have to stop. [bangs on glass window]

[Michael sits alone at the pancake table alone, the breeze blowing paper around.]

Michael: I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting. [The phone rings] It is a disgusting sandwich. [It rings again.] And the reason I tell you this story. [phone] Pick up the phone.
Pam: Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
Ryan: Keep going. [Whispers]
Michael: Don't tell them we have free delivery! [Also whispers]
Pam: We already offered free delivery!
Michael: They don't know that!
Pam: Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
Ryan: Write it down.
Michael: Give him a guarantee.
Pam: A guarantee of what?
Michael: Just say the word.
Pam: And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
Michael: Yes!
Pam: I made a sale!
Ryan: Oh!
Michael: You did!
Pam: Oh!
Michael: Oh yeah!
Ryan: We did it !
Michael: She did it!
Michael: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Dancing in the office]

Michael: Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really [flushing] Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important.

Andy: Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
Dwight: Cherry Pie, Warrant.
Andy: Better a cappella!
Dwight: No! Really?
Andy: Yeah. Name another.
Dwight: Enter Sandman, Metallica.
Andy: Better a cappella.
Dwight: Rebel Yell, Billy Idol
Andy: Aw!! Way better a cappella
Dwight: Really?
Andy: Yeah.
Pam: We could get Deangelo flowers.
Dwight: No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
Phyllis: That's true.
Jim: All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
Dwight: Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]
Jim: Nope. Baskets have it.

Jim: So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.

Jim: [on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
Dwight: [on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]
Jim: Wait...
Pam: What have you done?
Dwight [on phone]: Mose... you'll never guess where I am right now.
Mose [on phone]: Aaaaahhhhh!

Pam: Can't stay there all day.
Jim: I'm coming.
Pam: Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
Jim: You'd slow me down.

Jim: Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
Pam: Stop stalling! Come on.

All: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation...
All but Oscar: ...under God...
All: ...indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [Kevin finishes behind the rest of the group]
Angela: Amen.
Dwight: Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
Erin: Ooh, about what?
Dwight: That's on a need-to-know basis.
Erin: I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
Dwight: [quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
Jim: Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
Dwight: Define foment.
Jim: You define foment.
Dwight: [clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.

Dwight: [surprising Kelly] Aha!
Kelly: Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
Dwight: Gotcha! Why are you late?
Kelly: It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
Dwight: All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]

Andy: In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...
Erin: Oh! Darryl's funny.
Andy: I know, right?
Gabe: Hey, Andy?
Andy: Yeah?
Gabe: Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
Andy: Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe]
Gabe: Are you still in love with Erin?
Andy: What?
Gabe: Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
Andy: No, this is horrifying.
Gabe: No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
Andy: We're just friends, okay?
Gabe: Do you promise that?
Andy: Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?
Gabe: No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.

Dwight: [seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
Jim: Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
Dwight: You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
Jim: Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
Dwight: Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
Jim: And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it. [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]

Kevin: [inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...

Stanley: [refills his coffee near a sign that reads "Honor System: $0.50" with a camera pointed at it]

Andy: Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]

Dwight: I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.

Kevin: [looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
Creed: He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
Pam: You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
Creed: No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch.
Phyllis: He means the ice pack.

Erin: [on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call]
Gabe: I'm sorry. This can't wait.
Erin: He's just gonna call back.
Gabe: Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback]
Erin: [quietly] What?
Gabe: Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail?
Erin: Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
Gabe: Well... it's just... [ringing] it messes up my rhythm.

Erin: I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.

Jim: Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
Dwight: Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
Jim: And the desk.
Dwight: The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
Jim: Okay.
Dwight: Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
Jim: I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
Dwight: Don't make me fire you.
Jim: You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
Dwight: Don't make me pre-fire you.
Jim: You wouldn't dare.
Dwight: Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
Jim: [quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
Dwight: What?

Jim: If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "Well that's pretty premature to think," but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.

Dwight: How you doing, Jordan?
Jordan: I'm good.
Dwight: Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
Jordan: Why are you telling me this?
Dwight: Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.

Dwight: [walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.
Pam: Dwight, are you carrying a gun?
Dwight: The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
Andy: Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.
Dwight: The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
Pam: Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
Dwight: Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
Angela: Thank you.
Phyllis: You could put your cell phone in it instead.
Dwight: Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
Kevin: You could put a banana in it.
Dwight: Why would I put a banana in my holster?
Kevin: In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
Pam: Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.
Dwight: Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]
Erin: Andy!
Andy: Aah! Aah! It's so loud!

Oscar: My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
Andy: [trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.
Meredith: Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
Toby: Hey, what happened?
Kelly: Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
Dwight: No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
Andy: [scatting off-key] Something's definitely wrong.
Oscar: I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
Angela: Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
Oscar: [buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall.
Gabe: I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
Dwight: Okay, why are you calling Jo?
Andy: I think I should go the hospital.
Erin: I'll go with you.
Gabe: No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
Darryl: I'll take him.
Andy: Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]
Darryl: What's wrong with you?
Andy: It's my ear.
Darryl: Yeah.
Andy: Okay, sorry.
Toby: [excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before.
Gabe: I'm gonna keep trying Jo.
Dwight: Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!

Dwight: [enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
Stanley: We all saw you do it.
Dwight: Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
Erin: Navy blue. Little red anchors.
Dwight: I have no way of knowing if that's true.
Toby: I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands]
Dwight: Okay, really?
Toby: Would you consider this a terrorist incident?
Ryan: I felt terrorized.
Dwight: Come on.
Toby: Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.
Dwight: I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
Ryan: Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
Dwight: Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.

Andy: Hey. [Erin gasps] We're back.
Dwight: There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
Andy: Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
Dwight: Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
Andy: Yeah.
Phyllis: How's your hearing?
Andy: Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.

Darryl: I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.

Kelly: Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
Dwight: American Idol? What? No.
Kelly: Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
Dwight: No.
Kelly: [singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
Dwight: Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
Phyllis: Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
Angela: Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
Kevin: Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
Dwight: I put everything back in the vending machine.
Kevin: Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
Pam: You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
Dwight: Okay.
Jim: Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
Dwight: Thank God.
Jim: Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in "Shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
Dwight: What's jazz hands?
Jim: [quickly shakes his hands back and forth]
Dwight: Fine.

Dwight: [leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
Kevin: [after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...

Jo: Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers.
Dwight: Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
Jo: Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down.
Jim: Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
Jo: Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. [Jim coughs]
Dwight: [does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.

Andy: We have to clean this up now!
Erin: She had so much -
Gabe: Hey, guys.
Erin: Hey.
Gabe: Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Andy: No! [Erin and Andy laugh]
Gabe: Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?
Andy: Uh...
Gabe: I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
Andy: Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...
Gabe: No, I was not.
Andy: And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.

Dwight: Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
Kevin: Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.
Dwight: No, Kevin, come on.
Kevin: My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.
Dwight: Kevin, not now.
Kevin: Hey, Jo!
Dwight: Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
Kevin: No, under the jacket.
Dwight: You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
Kevin: I don't feel anything.
Dwight: Oh, it's so wet.
Kevin: Push harder, Dwight.
Dwight: I can't. I can't push harder!
Kevin: Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
Dwight: Okay, how's that?
Kevin: Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
Dwight: I'm kneading it!
Kevin: Don't eat it.
Jo: Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel?
Dwight: Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
Jo: What?!
Dwight: I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
Jo: Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?
Dwight: It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
Jo: Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid.
Dwight: I take full responsibility.
Jo: Who else would be responsible?
Dwight: Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
Pam: You shot a gun off -
Dwight: Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
Jo: Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius.
Dwight: Got it.
Jo: I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job.
Dwight: [on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -
Jo: No, child. No. It's over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement.

Jo: You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty?
Gabe: Yep.
Jim: Yep.
Jo: Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office?
Toby: Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority.
Jo: Who is it?

Jim: Hey, Dwight. What's up?
Dwight: Shut up.
Jim: Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]

Angela: [giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
Kevin: Another one?
Darryl and Angela: Yes!
Angela: Seven, two...
Oscar: Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
Angela: Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight...
Darryl: Nine first.
Angela: Nine, eight, five...
Kevin: Thank you.
Angela: Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six...
Kevin: Nice.
Angela: Two, one...
Kevin: Oh, I hit three. I hit three.
Angela: God!
