Well! It is a weeping and a moaning and a gnashing of teeth

Whoa make the ground move, that's an ass quake
Built a house up on that ass, that's an ass state
Roll my weed on it, that's an ass tray
Say Ye, say Ye, don't we do this every day-day?
I work them long nights, long nights to get a pay day
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
And niggas still hatin', so much hate I need an AK
Now we out in Paris, yeah I'm Perrierin'
White girls politicin' that's that Sarah Palin
Gettin' high, Californicatin'

Lamborghini Mercy

Hello! Hello!

I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James hoe
I'm bill droppin', Ms. Pac-Man is pill poppin' ass hoe
I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money
All she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist
Them heads turnin', that's exorcist
My Audemar like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time and that's excellence
Two door preference
Roof gone George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake
So your Duncan Heinz is irrelevant
Lambo, Mercy-lago, she go wherever I go
Wherever we go we do it pronto
Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick she so thirsty (Swirv)

Hello! Hello!
Well it is a weeping, and a mourning, and a gnashing of teeth
In the dance hall, and who no have teeth will run pon them gums
Caw when time it comes to my sound, which is the champion sound
The bugle has blown the many times, and it still have one more time left
Caw the amount of stripe weh deh pon our shoulder
Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam building like I'm the shit
Tell 'em "Give me fifty million or imma quit."
Most rappers taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass till it's up in your face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press, kid
Plus you're my bitch, make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary she gone off that Molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dhali
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I move in the lobby
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans
Now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane
Spit rounds like the gun range
Beat it up like Rampage
100 bands, cut ya girl now your girl need a band-aid
Grade A, A1, chain the color of Akon
Platinum diamonds backpack around me
Cosigned by Louis Vuitton
Horse power, horse power
All this Polo on I got horse power
Pound of this cost four thousand
I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain pourin', all my cars is foreign
All my broads is foreign, money tall like Jordan
Lamborghini Mercy
Your chick she so thirsty (Swirv)

Baby lion goes
Where the islands go
You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
ﾃ］dale ﾃ］dale E.I, E.I, uh, oh
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though
But I still drove 30 hours
But still drove 30 hours to you
I remember rapping for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret
Till I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need that happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in hurr, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you
You call down for an omelet
Girl it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob
Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga's dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job
And I drove back 30 hours
Were remains that long to lose sad
Better unsaid
Always turn, oh

Whole design team, Yeezy team, music team

Let that mothafucka rock, let that, let that, yeah
To my brother Yasiin, holding it out in Africa
30 hours
To my family, thank you for holding me down
The media be after us
*Phone call*
That's Gabe calling
Yo Gabe
I'm just doing a... just doing an adlib track right now
What's up?
30 hours
Intro - Kanye West:
Yeah, 9: 08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit
Verse 1 - Kanye West:
My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowing I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm going crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spending
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretending
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Grow conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission, on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Chorus - Sampha:
And you're looking at the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
I've been looking in the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky
Father, father, father
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
The night sky, I feel like I'm home, baby
Verse 2 - Kanye West:
I've been waking the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringing, go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The jews share they truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talking bout how my neck look?
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buying our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil working hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people, real
I've been working from enlightened man's dream
Checking Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm praying a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rapping
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams
One set of footsteps, you was carrying me
When I turned on the news and they was burying me
One set of footsteps, you was carrying me
When I was negotiating with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had the stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'm a never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, looking for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with an off the wall flow
Bridge - Sampha:
My life walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm delivering everything I've ever sent to you, bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Chorus - Sampha:
Yeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're looking in the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Outro - Sampha:
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me something before you leave
You've been treating me like I'm invisible
Now I'm visible to you, oh, invisible truths
They say I can't quite understand what you say
Understand, understand
Understand I'm standing on the oath
With my hand on the book
Tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
And you always give me half of you, half of you
Take half a shot, watching all my heart of gold
Make you feel like something from a film, oh
'Cause you know in the old days
They couldn't say the shit they wanted to say
They had to fake orgasms and shit
We can tell niggas today:
"Hey, I wanna cum, motherfucker!"
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (love it, love it)
(I'ma fuck a bitch, tell her cousin)

Then I fucked up on her cousin
Or her sister, I don't know nothin' (uh-uh, woo)
And my niggas gettin' ignorant
Like a lighter, bitch, we ignant (ignant, yeah)
All this water on my neck
Look like I fell when I went fishin' (fell!)
So much diamonds on my bust down
Ooh, fuck, what's the time? (where we at?)
Me and Smokepurpp sippin' drank (Purpp!)
Ooh, fuck, she take lines (lines)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it, scoop!)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho
When the first time they ask you if you want sparklin' or still?
Why you tryna act like you was drinkin' sparklin' water 'fore you came out here?
You're such a fuckin' h-
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)

I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I'll buy you a sick truck
I'll buy you some new tits, I'll get you that nip-tuck
How you start a family? The condom slipped up
I'm a sick fuck, I'm inappropriate
I like hearin' stories, I like that ho shit
I wanna hear mo' shit, I like the ho shit
Send me some mo' shit, you triflin' ho bitch (bitch, bitch, bitch)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)

I've been looking in the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky
Father, father, father
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
The night sky, I feel like I'm home, baby
Verse 2 - Kanye West:
I've been waking the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringing, go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The jews share they truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talking bout how my neck look?
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buying our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil working hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people, real
I've been working from enlightened man's dream
Checking Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm praying a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rapping
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams
One set of footsteps, you was carrying me
When I turned on the news and they was burying me
One set of footsteps, you was carrying me
When I was negotiating with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had the stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'm a never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, looking for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with an off the wall flow
Bridge - Sampha:
My life walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm delivering everything I've ever sent to you, bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Chorus - Sampha:
Yeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're looking in the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Outro - Sampha:
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me something before you leave
You've been treating me like I'm invisible
Now I'm visible to you, oh, invisible truths
They say I can't quite understand what you say
Understand, understand
Understand I'm standing on the oath
With my hand on the book
Tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
And you always give me half of you, half of you
Take half a shot, watching all my heart of gold
Make you feel like something from a film, oh
'Cause you know in the old days
They couldn't say the shit they wanted to say
They had to fake orgasms and shit
We can tell niggas today:
"Hey, I wanna cum, motherfucker!"
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (love it, love it)

You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it, scoop!)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)

When the first time they ask you if you want sparklin' or still?

You're such a fuckin' h-

I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I'll buy you a sick truck
I'll buy you some new tits, I'll get you that nip-tuck
How you start a family? The condom slipped up
I'm a sick fuck, I'm inappropriate
I like hearin' stories, I like that ho shit
I wanna hear mo' shit, I like the ho shit
Send me some mo' shit, you triflin' ho bitch (bitch, bitch, bitch)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
'Cause you know in the old days
They couldn't say the shit they wanted to say
They had to fake orgasms and shit
We can tell niggas today:
"Hey, I wanna cum, motherfucker!"

I think I've had enough, I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind, I might do a little time
Cause all of my kindness, is taken for weakness
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh that's all I want
Woke up an optimist, sun was shining I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back I'm bout' to spaz
Yeah, 'bout FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would drive me
Ooh that's all I want
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' how could I be so selfish
But you called bout a thousand times wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' how could I be so reckless
But I just can't apologize, I hope you can understand
If I go to jail tonight, promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride, but that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness, is taken for weakness
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh that's all I want
FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Just tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh that's all I want
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom, I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp, get the genie out the bottle
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Pussy good, go and back it up
Pipe her up, I'ma pipe her up
Make her mine, I done fell in love
Juicy thing, make that pussy say
"One more time, baby, do it big
Make it cry, come, go hold this shit"
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom, I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp, get the genie out the bottle
If I pull up with a Kerry Washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal, I could have Naomi Campbell
And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes, you gotta bag the boss up
I call that taking Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy your sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle, almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ay, time is extremely valuable and I prefer to waste it
On girls that's basic, that's just some Ye shit
Right now let's do what we want
Let's have a threesome with you and the blunt
I love your titties, 'cause they prove
I can focus on two things at once
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom, I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp, get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle
Let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
Ay, none of us would be here without cum
Ay, if it ain't all about the income
Ay, let me see you go ahead and spend some
Ay, if you driving 'round in some Dri-Fit
Ay, I'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
Hm, mhm, if I see you pull up with the three stripes
Ay, ay, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom, I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp, get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle
I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist, you make me run out of my skin
And I don't feel like
And I know you wouldn't leave
They say, "build your own", I said, "how, sway?"
I said, "slavery a choice", they said, "how, ye?"
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on fifty blogs getting fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say, "we 'bout to lose it all"
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave
And I know you wouldn't leave
When somethin' frees
We doin' such things
We could wait longer than this
Yes, you know you're one of these
We can run through with the top chopped, yeah
And the sundress down, ooh
And I know you wouldn't leave
Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time something happen, they want me sent to mental
We had an incident but I cover incidentals
You want me working on my messaging
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson but sounding like George Jefferson
Then they questioning my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two but me and you, that's infinity
And I know you wouldn't leave
I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist
You make me run out of my skin (run out of my skin)
And I don't feel like (uh)
And I know you wouldn't leave (love me or hate me)
For any guy that ever fucked up (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife (gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (oh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testing her loyalty
This what they mean when they say
"For better or for worse", huh?
For every down female that stuck with they dude
Through the best times, through the worst times
This for you
And I know you wouldn't leave

Hold up, hold up

Some day, I wanna tell everybody, some days
I wanna hit the red dot, I'll never find
Some days, some
Smokin' marijuana
Now that I'm livin' high, I do whatever I wanna, some day
I've been tryin', to make you love me
But everything I try, just takes you further from me
Some day we gon' set it off, some day we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all, on a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Some day the drama'll be gone, and they'll pray, no, oh, no
Sometimes I take all the shine, talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind, I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds, caught between space and time
This now, with the world in mind, but maybe some day
I've been tryin', to make you love me
But everything I try, just takes you further from me
Oh, once again I am a child
I let it all go, of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed

Woah, for all my dogs that stayed down, we up again (yeah)
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard
I had debt on my books, it's been a shaky ass year
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
I don't take advice from people less successful than me, huh?
Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Had to tell the dogs "Turn the snubs off"
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
(The Lord still shines on you)
(Believe it or not)
These two wrongs'll right you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)

The true soul of Ice Cube
Too close to snipe you (the Lord still shines on you)
Truth told, I like you

Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine and not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she's in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas, but yesterday is dead, yeah
Moment of silence, next she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repeat the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off
I'm sayin' it like
I want a daughter like Nicki, aww man, I promise
I'ma turn her to a monster, but no menagﾃｩs
I don't know how you saying it, but let 'em hear this
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say don't say this, don't say that
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good to compensate it
So it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See if I was trying to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright it's no sun, get so loud I hear none
Screamed so loud got no lungs, hurt so bad I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prrt-pum-pum-pum
Set the Newtone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need coconut rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say he die so young
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits
Used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we obey
We was all born to die, nigga DOA
Niggas say they hero, mhm, I don't see no cake
Mhm, I don't see no, mhm, yeah, I don't see no, mhm
If I wasn't signed to so hard there'd be no Shay
Buckwheat ass nigga, it's 'gon be otay
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pimp of the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay
Intro - Kanye West:
Yeah, 9: 08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit
Verse 1 - Kanye West:
My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowing I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm going crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spending
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretending
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Grow conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission, on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Chorus - Sampha:
And you're looking at the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
I've been looking in the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky
Father, father, father
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
The night sky, I feel like I'm home, baby
Verse 2 - Kanye West:
I've been waking the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringing, go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The jews share they truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talking bout how my neck look?
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buying our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil working hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people, real
I've been working from enlightened man's dream
Checking Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm praying a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rapping
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams
One set of footsteps, you was carrying me
When I turned on the news and they was burying me
One set of footsteps, you was carrying me
When I was negotiating with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had the stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'm a never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, looking for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with an off the wall flow
Bridge - Sampha:
My life walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm delivering everything I've ever sent to you, bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Chorus - Sampha:
Yeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're looking in the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Outro - Sampha:
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me something before you leave
You've been treating me like I'm invisible
Now I'm visible to you, oh, invisible truths
They say I can't quite understand what you say
Understand, understand
Understand I'm standing on the oath
With my hand on the book
Tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
And you always give me half of you, half of you
Take half a shot, watching all my heart of gold
Make you feel like something from a film, oh
Yeah
And you say Chi-City?
Chi-City, Chi-City
Chris Martin and Kanye West:
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again (Ow)
Kanye West:
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me"
Chris Martin:
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh
Now I'm coming home again
Maybe we could start again
Kanye West:
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what we tryna do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town
Chris Martin:
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
I'm in home again
Maybe, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan, oh
Now I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan, oh
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
I'm in home again
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
I'm in home again
Maybe we can start again
Baby lion goes
Where the islands go
You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
ﾃ］dale ﾃ］dale E.I, E.I, uh, oh
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though
But I still drove 30 hours
But still drove 30 hours to you
I remember rapping for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret
Till I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need that happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in hurr, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you
You call down for an omelet
Girl it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob
Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga's dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job
And I drove back 30 hours
Were remains that long to lose sad
Better unsaid
Always turn, oh
3 Stacks, can you help me out?
30 hours
Yeah, this the type of shit you ride out to
30 hours

Look at all these Ultralight Beams flowin'
For all the moms, dads, the kids, the families that shared this moment with us
Let's rock out for 'bout
30 hours
You know, ay you know
Ay, you know, ay, you know

Whole design team, Yeezy team, music team

To my family, thank you for holding me down
The media be after us
*Phone call*
That's Gabe calling
Yo Gabe
I'm just doing a... just doing an adlib track right now
What's up?
30 hours
I'm livin' in that 21st century, doin' something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
(21st century schizoid man)
The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We ain't got nothin' to lose, motherfucker, we rollin'
Huh? Motherfucker, we rollin'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So good night, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
Till then, fuck that, the world's ours
And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they
(21st century schizoid man)
Ooh, fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown-up thoughts
Reality is catchin' up with me
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece
Thinkin' no one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder
Till then, fuck that, the world's ours
And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they
(21st century schizoid man)
Colin Powers, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day, goddammit, I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit
I don't need yo' pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doin'? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'?
I got the power, make yo' life so excitin'
Now this'll be a beautiful death
(I'm jumpin' out the window
Lettin' everything go
Lettin' everything go)
Now this'll be a beautiful death
(Jumpin' out the window
Lettin' everything go
Lettin' everything go)
Now this'll be a beautiful death

Lettin' everything go)
You got the power to let power go?
